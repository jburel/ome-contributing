Virtual Microscope Testing
==========================


**Production server**: <https://learning.openmicroscopy.org/dundee/>
**Staging server**: <https://ray.openmicroscopy.org/dundee/>

**Public Gallery on production server**: <https://learning.openmicroscopy.org/dundee/gallery/>
**Public Gallery on staging server**: <https://ray.openmicroscopy.org/dundee/gallery/>


**Purpose of the test** is to check the functioning of the Virtual Microscope.


#. Testing cache

   - All urls matching ``webclient/render_*`` and ``webgateway/*`` are cached for 1 minute to simplify testing
   - You can use only public urls for this testing, i.e. only the image IDs taken from Public Gallery when NOT logged in 
   - Either use Firebug, development tools in your web browser or, preferably, open console to check response using ``$ curl -I  TESTED_URL``
   - Go through following 5 steps to |C| that the cache is working properly, working on the command line and only using the Public Gallery to take the image IDs from (repolace the ``1290`` in the examples below with the IDs you need to test). The expected output is included in the examples below.

      - cache wiped out on the server (use an image which was not pointed to by curl yet)

      ::

          $ curl -I https://ray.openmicroscopy.org/dundee/webgateway/img_detail/1290/
          HTTP/1.1 200 OK
          Date: Wed, 02 Dec 2015 09:27:55 GMT
          X-Proxy-Cache: MISS

      - another request immediately after

      ::

          $ curl -I https://ray.openmicroscopy.org/dundee/webgateway/img_detail/1290/
          HTTP/1.1 200 OK
          Date: Wed, 02 Dec 2015 09:28:00 GMT
          X-Proxy-Cache: HIT

      - one minute later, after cache expired

      ::

          $ curl -I https://ray.openmicroscopy.org/dundee/webgateway/img_detail/1290/
          HTTP/1.1 200 OK
          Date: Wed, 02 Dec 2015 09:30:02 GMT
          X-Proxy-Cache: EXPIRED

      - request content that shouldn't be cached

      ::

          $ curl -I https://ray.openmicroscopy.org/dundee/webclient/login/
          HTTP/1.1 200 OK
          Date: Wed, 02 Dec 2015 09:31:10 GMT
          X-Proxy-Cache: BYPASS

      - static file cache:

      ::

          $ curl -I https://ray.openmicroscopy.org/dundee/static/webclient/image/logo_login_web.png
          Cache-Control: max-age=2592000

.. Note::
   ``X-Proxy-Cache`` can show various status (From https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-caching-guide/):
      
       -  MISS – The response was not found in the cache and so was fetched from an origin server. The response might then have been cached.
       -  BYPASS – The response was fetched from the origin server instead of served from the cache because the request matched a proxy_cache_bypass directive. The response might then have been cached.
       -  EXPIRED – The entry in the cache has expired. The response contains fresh content from the origin server.
       -  STALE – The content is stale because the origin server is not responding correctly, and proxy_cache_use_stale was configured.
       -  UPDATING – The content is stale because the entry is currently being updated in response to a previous request, and proxy_cache_use_stale updating is configured.
       -  REVALIDATED – The proxy_cache_revalidate directive was enabled and NGINX verified that the current cached content was still valid (If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match).
       -  HIT – The response contains valid, fresh content direct from the cache.

     

#. Public gallery testing
   - |C| in the top menu bar that you are not logged in as a Public User (in case you are logged in as yourself or other user, then just logout and navigate to the page again). Note that this is a known unrelated problem, just make sure you are logged in as Public User (see ticket <https://trac.openmicroscopy.org/ome/ticket/12991>).
   - |C| if you see only 4 images in public examples.
   - Double click on each slide and open full viewer. Zoom in and out. Load ROIs if possible.

#. General testing

   -  Log in using your UoD LDAP credentials. The login name should be case insensitive. |C| that when you try various combinations of upper and lower case, you can still log in.
   -  |C| if group/user menu display "All courses" and name of courses only.
   -  Choose one of the courses from the list. Check if you ended up viewing data belonging to the user named as a course.
   -  Browse through each catalog and see if the slides' thumbnails load.
   -  Click on each slide and see if the metadata panels load. Please note that preview is turned off.
   -  |C| if download button is restricted to Render as JPEG/PNG/TIFF only. Download raw data should be disabled.
   -  |C| if you cannot delete tags.
   -  |C| if you cannot download original data.
   -  |C| if scripts are disabled and there is no script listed in Script menu. Note that Script button is still available in Metadata Panel but it should throw an exception.
   -  Double click on each slide and open full viewer. Zoom in and out. Load ROIs if possible.
