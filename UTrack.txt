U-Track
=======

Purpose of the test is to check the functionality of the U-Track application.

U-Track is a MATLAB-based software program for tracking single particles,
microtubules plus-ends or labelled nuclei. It can run against multi-frame
images stored under an OMERO server containing either of these objects.
Multi-channel images are supported but multi-Z images are currently not
supported.

.. note::
	Because U-Track deals with multi-frame images, the term "movie" used in
	this scenario matches the U-Track PDF documentation in meaning
	"multi-frame images".

For the purpose of the testing scenario describe below, an example dataset
can be downloaded: :images_downloads:`integrins.zip <u-track/integrins.zip>`.
This zip file contains two OME-TIFF files which are crops of an original
multi-frame fluorescent image of labelled integrins with different
signal-to-noise ratios.

#. Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your machine.

#. Download the latest OMERO.matlab toolbox corresponding to the OMERO server
   to test against using :jenkinsjob:`OMERO-4.4-merge-daily` or
   :jenkinsjob:`OMERO-5.0-merge-daily`.

#. Download the latest build of U-Track from :jenkinsjob:`U-TRACK-latest` or
   the release candidate from :jenkinsjob:`U-TRACK-release` and unzip it.

#. Import test images onto the OMERO server using OMERO.insight.

#. Start MATLAB.

#. Add U-Track and the OMERO.matlab toolbox to the Matlab path. Navigate to
   the :file:`OMERO.matlab` directory, right-click on it and select
   :menuselection:`Add to Path -> Selected Folders And SubFolders`. Repeat the
   same operation for the :file:`U-Track` directory.

#. Start the movie selection interface by typing ``movieSelectorGUI`` at the
   MATLAB prompt.

   - |C| that the `Movie selection` graphical interface opens.

#. In the top-level menu, select :menuselection:`OMERO -> Log in`. In the
   `OMERO login` graphical interface enter the credentials and click on
   :guilabel:`Log in`. Adjust the group if necessary using the drop-down menu.

   - |C| that the status line indicates a connection is created to the server.

#. In the top-level menu, select :menuselection:`OMERO -> Load data`. In the
   `OMERO data selection` interface, browse through your projects/datasets,
   select the images to be analyzed and click on
   :guilabel:`Load selected images`.

   - |C| that the MATLAB command window displays information about the movie
     loading.
   - |C| that the movies are added to the list of movies to process in the
     U-Track `Movie selection` graphical interface.
   - |C| that a file annotation is created and attached to the selected image
     using either OMERO.insight or OMERO.web.

#. Go to the `OMERO data selection` graphical interface, re-select loaded
   movies and click on :guilabel:`Load selected images`.

    - |C| that an error message informs that the movies have already been
      loaded.

#. In the right panel, make sure :guilabel:`U-Track` is selected and click
   :guilabel:`Continue` at the bottom of the interface.

#. If the image has never been analyzed by U-Track previously, a pop-up window
   should open asking which objects should be tracked. Choose
   `Single particles` as the type of objects to track. The main analysis panel
   should open.

#. Set the detection parameters by clicking on the :guilabel:`Setting` button
   next to ``Step 1: Detection``. Select the default detection method
   (Gaussian Mixture Model Fitting) and click on :guilabel:`Setting`. Fill the
   camera bit depth and Gaussian standard deviation if these parameters are
   not specified in the movie metadata. Click on :guilabel:`Apply` to accept
   the default detection settings.

   - |C| that **Step 1: Detection** appears in bold, i.e. that the detection
     step is set up for this movie.
   - |C| that checkbox next to **Step 1: Detection** is checked, i.e. that the
     detection step is scheduled for running.

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Run` button under the list of steps.

   - |C| that the software starts the analysis at the MATLAB command prompt.
   - |C| that a window pops up informing that the step has been completed
     successfully.
   - |C| that a green icon appears next to the detection step once it is run
     successfully.

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Result` button next to **Step 1: Detection**. Three
   graphical windows should open. One of them, called ``Movie``, shows the
   movie planes with the analysis results overlaid on top of it. A second
   window called ``Viewer`` allows to navigate through the time dimension via
   a scrollbar.

   - |C| that the detection results are overlaid by default on top of the
     image plane as red circles.
   - |C| that you can scroll through the frames of the movie and the plane and
     detection results are updated.
   - |C| that you can run the movie by clicking the :guilabel:`Run movie`
     button.
   - |C| that closing the ``Viewer`` graphical interface closes all the
     viewing windows.

#. Set the tracking parameters by clicking on the :guilabel:`Setting` button
   next to ``Step 2: Tracking``. Click on :guilabel:`Apply` to accept the
   default tracking parameters.

   - |C| that **Step 2: Tracking** appears in bold, i.e. that the tracking
     step is set up for this movie.
   - |C| that checkbox next to **Step 2: Tracking** is checked, i.e. that the
     detection step is scheduled for running.

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Run` button under the list of steps.

   - |C| that the software starts the tracking at the MATLAB command prompt.
   - |C| that a window pops up informing that the step has been completed
     successfully.
   - |C| that a green icon appears next to the tracking step once it is run
     successfully.

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Result` button next to **Step 2: Tracking**.

   - |C| that the tracks are overlaid by default on top of the image plane as
     red paths. To check this, scroll through the frames of the movie and
     make sure the tracks are updated.

   - |C| that the track dragtail length can be controlled. Choose a frame in
     the middle of the movie. In the ``Movie options`` graphical interface,
     modify the ``Dragtail length`` edit box to different values in the range
     between 1 and the number of timepoints of the movie e.g. 1, 5, 10... and
     hit Enter. |C| that the tracks dragtail is updated.
