U-Track
=======

Purpose of the test is to check the functionality of the U-Track application.

#. Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your machine

#. Download the OMERO.matlab toolbox corresponding to the OMERO server to test 
   against from :omero_downloads:`the OMERO downloads page<>`.

#. Download the latest build of U-Track from :jenkinsjob:`U-track-release` and unzip.

#. Import test images onto the OMERO server using OMERO.insight. 
   :images_downloads:`Public example images <u-track>` can be downloaded.
   Note the ID(s) of the image(s) to analyze.

#. Start MATLAB

#. Add u-track and the OMERO.matlab toolbox to the Matlab path. Navigate to 
   the directory containing the folders, click right on them and select 
   :menuselection:`Add to Path -> Selected Folders And SubFolders`

#. Start the movie selection interface by typing ``movieSelectorGUI`` at the  
   MATLAB prompt.

   - |C| that the movie selection graphical interface opens.

#. In the top-level menu, select :menuselection:`OMERO -> Log in`. In the 
   login graphical interface enter the credentials and click on
   :guilabel:`Log in`. Adjust the group if necessary using the drop-down menu.

   - |C| that the status line indicates a connection is created to the server.

#. In the top-level menu, select :menuselection:`OMERO -> Load Image`, enter 
   the ID of the test image.

   - |C| that the movie is added to the list of movies to analyze
   - |C| that a file annotation is created and attached to the selected image 
     using either OMERO.insight or OMERO.web

#. In the right panel, make sure :guilabel:`U-Track` is selected and click 
   :guilabel:`Continue` at the bottom of the interface.

#. If the image has never been analyzed by u-track previously, a pop-up window  
   should open asking which objects should be tracked. Choose 
   single-particles as the type of objects to track. The main analysis panel   
   should open.

#. Set the detection parameters by clicking on the :guilabel:`Setting` button 
   next to ``Step 1: Detection``. Select the default detection method 
   (Gaussian Mixture Model Fitting) and click on :guilabel:`Setting`. Click on 
   :guilabel:`Apply` to accept the default detection settings

   - |C| that **Step 1: Detection** appears in bold meaning the detection step 
     is set up for this movie

#. Check the checkbox next to **Step 1: Detection** and click on the 
   :guilabel:`Run` button at the bottom of the window.

   - |C| that the software starts the analysis at the MATLAB command prompt
   - |C| that a green icon appears next to the detection step once it is run 
     successfully

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Result` button next to **Step 1: Detection**. Three 
   graphical windows should open. One of them, called ``Movie`` shows the 
   movie planes with the analysis results overlaid on top of it. A second 
   window called ``Viewer`` allows to navigate through the time dimension via 
   a scrollbar. 

   - |C| that the detection results are overlaid by default on top of the 
     image plane as red circles.
   - |C| that you can scroll through the frames of the movie and the plane and 
     detection results are updated.
   - |C| that you can run the movie by clicking the :guilabel:`Run movie` 
     button.
   - |C| that closing the ``Viewer`` graphical interface closes all the 
     viewing windows.

#. Set the tracking parameters by clicking on the :guilabel:`Setting` button 
   next to ``Step 2: Tracking``. Click on :guilabel:`Apply` to accept the 
   default tracking parameters.

   - |C| that **Step 2: Tracking** appears in bold meaning the tracking step 
     is set up for this movie

#. Check the checkbox next to **Step 2: Tracking** and click on the 
   :guilabel:`Run` button at the bottom of the window.

   - |C| that the software starts the tracking at the MATLAB command prompt
   - |C| that a green icon appears next to the tracking step once it is run 
     successfully

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Result` button next to **Step 2: Tracking**.

   - |C| that the tracks are overlaid by default on top of the image plane as 
     red circles. To check this, scroll through the frames of the movie and 
     make sure the tracks are updated.

   - |C| that the track dragtail length can be controlled. Choose a frame in 
     the middle of the movie. In the ``Movie options`` graphical interface, 
     modify the ``Dragtail length`` edit box to different values: 1, 5, 10...
     |C| that the tracks dragtail is updated.
