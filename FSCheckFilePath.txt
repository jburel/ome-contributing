Check Filepath (FS)
====================



**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check the filepath to the image which is shown in clients in FS

#. Click on an image imported in FS. Go to the right-hand pane, tab "General". Click onto the filepath icon [:ref:`FSCheckFilePathScreen002w`] (images 002in, 002w). A table with the paths of the files associated with the chosen image will appear under the icon. [:ref:`FSCheckFilePathScreen003w`]

#. Go to the server and find the file according to the given filepath [:ref:`FSCheckFilePathScreen004`].


   - Go to the server, directory `/OMERO/ManagedRepository/<filepath>` [:download:`Path example </downloads/check_path.txt>`].
   - |C| that the path in the clients and the filepath on the server match 

#. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with multi-image file, like `lei`
