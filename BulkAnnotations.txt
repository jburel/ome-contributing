Bulk Annotations
=================



**To test in**: Command line interface / Insight and Web (for Web - last step only)

**Purpose of the test** is to check the creation of bulk annotations using a python script started from CLI

**Please indicate your Python and Ice version number in the ticket or error report in case you are having problems with the script**

#. You must have

   - A working Python and Ice on the test machine (Python 2.7.2 and Ice 3.3 worked fine at the time this scenario was written) 
   - Downloaded (and extracted) `OMERO.server*.zip` from Jenkins build (for example `OMERO.server-4.4.4-819-777c235-dirty-ice33-b115.zip`)
   - Copied the ".csv" files from squig (test_plate.csv, test_screen.csv) i.e.

         - `ome/team/screenshots/Testing Setup/Bulk annotations/test_plate.csv`
         - `ome/team/screenshots/Testing Setup/Bulk annotations/test_screen.csv`

#. Either in Insight UI or command line, create a Screen and note the Screen ID

#. Import `ome/data_repo/from_skyking/mias/frans/siRNA_PRIM1_03102008/001-365700055641` into the Screen created in step 2. 

#. Import `ome/data_repo/from_skyking/mias/frans/siRNA_PRIM1_03102008/001-365700055641` **again**, this time not into a Screen and note the Plate ID

#. Open a terminal and go to `OMERO.server-*/lib/python/` (for example `OMERO.server-4.4.4-819-777c235-dirty-ice33-b115/lib/python/`)

#. Run the bulk annotation `populate_metadata.py` script for the MIAS dataset you imported into the Screen:

      `PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python omero/util/populate_metadata.py -s <hostname> -u <username> Screen:<screen_id> path/to/test_screen.csv`

   - For example (assuming that test_screen.csv is located on your Desktop):

      `PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python omero/util/populate_metadata.py -s howe.openmicroscopy.org.uk -u user-1 Screen:51 ~/Desktop/test_screen.csv`

#. Run the bulk annotation populate_metadata.py script for the MIAS dataset you imported without a Screen:

      `PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python omero/util/populate_metadata.py -s <hostname> -u <username> Plate:<plate_id> path/to/test_plate.csv`

   - For example (assuming that test_plate.csv is located on your Desktop)

      `PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python omero/util/populate_metadata.py -s howe.openmicroscopy.org.uk -u user-1 Plate:101 ~/Desktop/test_plate.csv`

   - |C| that you can see following console output as a result of steps 6 and 7 [:ref:`BulkAnnotScreen001Nout`]. 

#. Open or go to the previously opened Insight UI

#. |C| that there is a "bulk_annotations" File Annotation attached to the Screen you created and imported into

#. |C| that there is a "bulk_annotations" File Annotation attached to the Plate you imported without a Screen

#. Select the Plate without a Screen and select each of the 16 Wells with an image in the middle panel individually, one at a time:



   - |C| that the metadata is visible in the bottom left hand corner of the Insight tree view to the right of the Plate grid [:ref:`BulkAnnotScreen001`]
   - |C| "Well" metadata is different for each selected Well
   - |C| "Well Name" is correct for the selected Well
   - |C| that the metadata match with the `test_plate.csv` (open the `.csv` in Excel)

#. Select the Plate you imported into a Screen and select each of the 16 Wells with an image in the middle panel individually, one at a time:



   - |C| that the metadata is visible in the bottom left hand corner of the Insight tree view to the right of the Plate grid [:ref:`BulkAnnotScreen001`]
   - |C| the metadata is different for each selected Well
   - |C| "Well Name" is correct for the selected Well
   - |C| "Plate" is the same for each selected Well and matches the Plate's ID
   - |C| "Plate Name" is the same for each selected Well and matches the Plate's name
   - |C| that the metadata match with the `test_screen.csv` (open the `.csv` in Excel)



#. Using Web client, open the Plate without Screen, open an image in Full Viewer and click onto the "Image Information" link [:ref:`BulkAnnotScreen004NWeb`]  

   - |C| that you can see the metadata annotations [:ref:`BulkAnnotScreen002NWeb`, :ref:`BulkAnnotScreen005NWeb`]
   - |C| that the annotations in Web match the ones displayed in Insight and in the test_plate.csv.
