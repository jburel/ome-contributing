Bulk Annotations
=================



**To test in**: Command line interface / Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check the creation of bulk annotations using a python script started from CLI

#. You must have

   - A working Python and Ice on the test machine  
   - Downloaded (and extracted) `OMERO.server*.zip`
   - Copied the ".csv" files from squig (test_plate.csv, test_screen.csv) i.e.

         - `ome/team/screenshots/Testing Setup/Bulk annotations/test_plate.csv`
         - `ome/team/screenshots/Testing Setup/Bulk annotations/test_screen.csv`

#. Either in Insight UI or command line, create a Screen and note the Screen ID

#. Import `ome/data_repo/from_skyking/mias/frans/siRNA_PRIM1_03102008/001-365700055641` into the Screen created in step 2. 

#. Import `ome/data_repo/from_skyking/mias/frans/siRNA_PRIM1_03102008/001-365700055641` **again**, this time not into a Screen and note the Plate ID

#. In command line interface, change directory into `OMERO.server-*/lib/python/`

#. Run the bulk annotation `populate_metadata.py` script for the MIAS dataset you imported into the Screen:

      `PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python omero/util/populate_metadata.py -s <hostname> -u <username> Screen:<screen_id> path/to/test_screen.csv`

   - If for example you have downloaded the CSVs to your desktop, have imported into Screen 51, are using howe and performing the tests as user-1:

      `PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python omero/util/populate_metadata.py -s howe.openmicroscopy.org.uk -u user-1 Screen:51 ~/Desktop/test_screen.csv`

#. Run the bulk annotation populate_metadata.py script for the MIAS dataset you imported without a Screen:

      `PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python omero/util/populate_metadata.py -s <hostname> -u <username> Plate:<plate_id> path/to/test_plate.csv`

   - If for example you have downloaded the CSVs to your desktop, ended up with an imported Plate 101, are using howe and performing the tests as user-1:

      `PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python omero/util/populate_metadata.py -s howe.openmicroscopy.org.uk -u user-1 Plate:101 ~/Desktop/test_plate.csv`

#. Open or go to the previously opened Insight UI

#. |C| that there is a "bulk_annotations" File Annotation attached to the Screen you created and imported into

#. |C| that there is a "bulk_annotations" File Annotation attached to the Plate you imported without a Screen

#. With the Plate that you imported without a Screen select each of the 16 Wells with an Image in the middle panel individually:

   - |C| Metadata is visible in the bottom left hand corner of the OMERO.insight tree view to the right of the Plate grid [:ref:`BulkAnnotScreen001`]
   - |C| "Well" metadata is different for each selected Well
   - |C| "Well Name" is correct for the selected Well
   - |C| that the metadata match with the `test_screen.csv` (open the `.csv` in Excel)

#. With the Plate that you imported into a Screen select each of the 16 Wells with an Image in the middle panel individually:

   - |C| Metadata is visible in the bottom left hand corner of the OMERO.insight tree view to the right of the Plate grid [:ref:`BulkAnnotScreen001`]
   - |C| the metadata is different for each selected Well
   - |C| "Well Name" is correct for the selected Well
   - |C| "Plate" is the same for each selected Well and matches the Plate's ID
   - |C| "Plate Name" is the same for each selected Well and matches the Plate's name
   - |C| that the metadata match with the `test_plate.csv` (open the `.csv` in Excel)
