Jekyll-hosted websites
======================

A number of OME websites are produced using `Jekyll <https://jekyllrb.com/>`_,
including:

- `Main OME website <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/>`_
- `OME blog <https://blog.openmicroscopy.org/>`_
- `OME Help site <https://help.openmicroscopy.org/>`_
- `OMERO.figure website <https://figure.openmicroscopy.org/>`_

These sites can be built and tested by installing a local copy of Jekyll.
The Help and Figure sites are also built by CI jobs, see :doc:`ci-docs`.

The publicly released pages are hosted and automatically generated by
`GitHub Pages`_ with a `custom subdomain
<https://help.github.com/articles/about-custom-domains-for-github-pages-sites/>`_.

Installing Jekyll
-----------------

Jekyll can be installed as a system application (requires administrator
privileges) or for a single user.

1. Install a recent version of Ruby. Recent versions of OS X and Linux may
   already include a suitable version, however you will require
   administrator privileges to install Jekyll.
   Alternatively on OS X you can use Homebrew, and on Linux either `rbenv
   <https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv>`_ or `RVM <https://rvm.io/>`_::

       brew install ruby

2. Install Jekyll::

       gem install jekyll


Running Jekyll
--------------

In a terminal enter the local git checkout and run::

    jekyll serve -w -b ''

This will build the web pages and start a local server on
http://localhost:4000/.
Jekyll should automatically rebuild the pages when changes are made to the
source files, and will override any `baseurl` defined in `_config.yml`.

Editing the websites
--------------------

Main OME Website
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The source for the `OME Website <https://www.openmicroscopy.org>`_ is
on GitHub at https://github.com/ome/www.openmicroscopy.org.
The website uses the ‘master’ branch, PRs should be opened directly against
it. Most of the files are written in html but the announcements posts are in
markdown and further content may migrate to markdown in future.

Once a PR is open and has passed Travis, it will be integrated in the
staging integration branch for the OME Website site via the daily
:jenkinsjob:`WWW-merge` job. The staging Jekyll website will be deployed
by the `GitHub Pages`_ service at
https://snoopycrimecop.github.io/www.openmicroscopy.org for review.

Once the PR is merged, the HEAD of master will be deployed by the
`GitHub pages`_ service at
https://openmicroscopy.github.io/www.openmicroscopy.org.

Updating the live website requires two steps, first creating an archive of the
static website and then deploying it on the web server:

- to release the Jekyll source code, a signed Git tag needs to be created from
  the master branch of the source code. Website tags must follow the
  [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/#youtube-dl) scheme using the tag
  date
- after pushing the tag, an artifact of the static website will be built by
  [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/openmicroscopy/www.openmicroscopy.org) and 
  deployed as an asset of the associated `GitHub release <https://github.com/ome/www.openmicroscopy.org/releases>`_
- a PR can then be opened against the
  `Website deployment playbook <https://github.com/ome/prod-playbooks/blob/master/www/www-static.yml>`_ to consume the new release asset
- the sysadmin team will then run the playbook to update the live website

OME Blog
^^^^^^^^

The source for `blog.openmicroscopy.org <https://blog.openmicroscopy.org>`_ is
at `<https://github.com/ome/blog>`_.
The website uses the 'gh-pages' branch and as there is no merge build or
staging page, you should open a PR directly against this branch. The files are
written in markdown. Branches must be built locally for review and merging PRs
automatically updates the live site.

Help site
^^^^^^^^^

`help.openmicroscopy.org <https://help.openmicroscopy.org>`_ has been redirected to 
covers OMERO user `<https://omero-guides.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ when possible.
Original pages without a guide e.g. mtools, have been redirected 
to `<https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/help/pdfs/>`_.
When features e.g. roi folders are added to the `<https://omero-guides.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
some redirects might need to be updated.

The source is at `<https://github.com/ome/ome-help/>`_.
The website uses the ‘master’ branch for the live deployment.


Figure website
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`<https://figure.openmicroscopy.org/>`_ is a legacy site from before
OMERO.figure was considered a core part of the project.
It has been redirected to https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/figure/
Redirect could not be put in place for some specific blog entries.
They can still be found at  `<https://github.com/ome/omero-figure/tree/master/docs/_posts>`_

The source is at `<https://github.com/ome/omero-figure/>`_.

The website uses the ‘master/docs’ branch for the live deployment.
