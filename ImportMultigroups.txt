Import and Multigroups
======================



**To test in**: Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to test the import of images into multiple groups and check the Import Queue behaviour in this case

#. Import the same image in 2 different groups. Find suitable images here [:download:`TestingSet </downloads/ImportTestingSetTable.pdf>`] or here [:download:`TestingTemplate </downloads/ImportTestingTemplate.pdf>`]

   - Open Importer window, select an image, click onto ">" to bring up the "Import Location" window 
   - Choose where to import the image in the first group [:ref:`ImportMultiGrScreen000a`]
   - Do not change the selection of images, switch group and select where to import the image in the second group [:ref:`ImportMultiGrScreen000b`].
   - Import the images
   - Go back to the Data Manager and add the 2 groups to the display if not already added. [:ref:`ImportMultiGrScreen001`]
   - |C| Make sure that the image is in the correct location (in both groups). [:ref:`ImportMultiGrScreen002`]


#. "Import Location" window - group update

   - Open Importer window, select an image, click onto ">" to bring up the "Import Location" window 
   - Choose where to import the image in the first group [:ref:`ImportMultiGrScreen000a`].
   - Close the "Import Location" window, leave the importer open and go to Data Manager, into the tree (left pan) [:ref:`ImportMultiGrScreen002`]
   - Expand a group (NOT the one you have previously selected in the "Import Location" window)
   - Select a user
   - Go back to the importer, click onto ">" and |C| that the group display matches your choice in Data Manager



#. Import queue

   - Select files to import and select the "New From folder" option[default option] in the location dialog.
   - Start the import
   - Start immediately (while the previous import is still not finished !) a new import with the same selected files .
   - In the location dialog, switch group and select "New From Folder", then add images to the queue and click "Import".
   - Go back to the Data Manager and add the 2 groups to the display if not already added.
   - |C| that the image is in the correct locations.
