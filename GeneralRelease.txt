General Release
================



**To test in**: Web, Insight, OMERO.server, IJ/Fiji Plugin, Webstart

**Purpose of the test** is to make sure the particular application on the release day is built correctly and starts and connects and opens an image as expected (when applicable).

#. Download the correct build as indicated on the Standup Notes.

   - |C| the build is available and has a non-zero size


OMERO.clients:

#. Open the application and login as any user

   - |C| that the application starts and you can log in
   - |C| that you can open an image

IJ/Fiji Plugin

#. Follow https://www.openmicroscopy.org/private/ome-internal/testing_scenarios/InsightasPluginImageJFiji.html 

OMERO.server

#. Unzip the downloaded file. 
#. Configure the server
#. Start the server.

   -|C| the server starts as expected

#. Download and open OMERO.insight and OMERO.web
#. Connect in OMERO.insight and OMERO.web to the server you just started

   -|C| the clients connect to the server


Webstart

#. Download and deploy the release server and start OMERO.web - start Webstart, connect and open an image.

   - |C| the application starts, you can connect and an image opens as expected

OMERO.matlab toolbox

#. Follow the workflow described in  https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/developers/Matlab.html using the build indicated in the Standup Notes. The purpose of following this workflow is just to enable you to execute following 6 commands:

``session = client.createSession(user,pass)``
``image = getImages(session, imageID)``
``plane = getPlane(session, image, 0, 0, 0);``
``datasets  = getDatasets(session)``
``figure; imshow(plane, []);``
``client.closeSession()``

   -|C| that all 6 commands executed without errors
   -|C| that after ``figure; imshow(plane, []);`` the image is displayed in Matlab

OMERO Virtual Appliance

#. Follow https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/users/virtual-appliance.html?highlight=virtual%20appliance to get the Virtual Appliance started - skip the steps as appropriate in case you have already installed Virtual Box. 

#. Start OMERO.insight and OMERO.web as described in https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/users/virtual-appliance.html?highlight=virtual%20appliance and try to login.

   - |C| that Insight and Web start okay and you can login successfully
   - |C| that you can import and then open a small image (any small image will do)

Bio-Formats MATLAB toolbox

#. Follow instructions here http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats5/developers/matlab-dev.html up to and including the section ``Displaying images``. Use any small image on your local disk or on squig.

   - |C| that the image opens as expected

Bio-Formats loci_tools.jar

#. Remove any previous loci_tools.jar files out of your ImageJ Plugins folder. Put the freshly downloaded loci_tools.jar into a Plugins folder of ImageJ and start ImageJ.

   - |C| that there is a ``LOCI`` menu item under the ``Plugins`` menu

#. Go ``Plugins`` > ``LOCI`` > ``Bio-formats Importer`` and import a small image (any small image will do).

   - |C| that the image imports successfully

Bio-Formats command-line tools

#. Download and unzip the bftools.zip. 
#. Download loci_tools.jar and place the jar into the unzipped bftools folder.
#. Cd into this folder and execute the ``bfconvert`` command on the cmd line, for example 
``[petr@LS25165 ~/Downloads/bftools]$ ./bfconvert <path-to-image>.png  <path-to-image-to-create>.avi``
   
   -|C| that a new image with the name you chose and the extension .avi was created
#. View the newly created image using ``bfview`` command, for example
``[petr@LS25165 ~/Downloads/bftools]$ ./bfview ~/Desktop/converted.avi ``

   -|C| that the image opens
