Delete
=======



**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check the Delete function on all entities (except ROI)


If you test work on others' data (permissions) go first to :ref:`Section 2: Work on others data <label-Delete>`

**Section 1: Work on your own data**

.. _delete-work-own:

#. In the DataManager:

   - Delete Ratings (Insight only), Delete Comments (right-hand pane)
   - Delete attachments [:ref:`Delete001`][:ref:`Delete002`] (left-hand pane in Insight, right hand pane in Web)
   - Delete tags [:ref:`Delete003`][:ref:`Delete004`] (left-hand pane)

#. Delete P/D/I/Screen/Plate. [:ref:`Delete005`][:ref:`Delete006`][:ref:`Delete007`][:ref:`Delete008`]

#. Import an image rich in metadata and delete it.

#. Import a multi-image file (e.g. ``test_images_good/lei/050118.lei``). Choose one image only and press Delete. NB: The delete action should not proceed - instead an info will be produced, indicating that you must select all the images in the multi-image file to be able to delete the whole file.

**End of Section 1: Work on your own data**

.. _label-Delete:

**Section 2: Work on other users' data**


- |C| the permissions of the user you have been assigned to use here: :ref:`Table of permissions-users <Table-of-permissions-users>`
- |C| whether you CAN (=Y) or CANNOT (=N) delete other's data in the table below (alternatively see all permissions :omerodoc:`here <sysadmins/server-permissions.html>`)
