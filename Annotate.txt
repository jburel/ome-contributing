Annotate
========



**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check the Annotate ability (creating as well as viewing) for P/D/I/S/Plates/Plate Acquisitions

**Section 1: General Annotations**

#. Annotate different type of objects i.e. Projects/Datasets/Images/Screens/Plates/Plate Acquisitions (=Plate Run)

   - Comments (right-hand pane [:ref:`Annotate001`])

   - Rating (right-hand pane)

   - Attachments (right-hand pane)

     - Attach local documents
     - Attach uploaded documents. 
      
       - (Insight only) |C| that you can filter the ``Available`` documents [:ref:`Annotate021`]. 





#. Create a file of size 0 and add it as an attachment to P/D/I/S/P/PR.

#. Repeat step 1., selecting each time more than 2 objects for annotation at one go [:ref:`AnnotateM001`].

   - |C| that each of the selected object has been annotated, and you still see the annotation when selecting them one-by-one
   - |C| that when you select the annotated objects together with non-annotated objects, the annotation is still visible in right-hand pane [:ref:`AnnotateM002`]
   
#. Select more than 2 objects and attach an existing tag. 

#. Select again more than 2 objects, this time choose objects tagged in step 3. as well as untagged objects and try to add the tag from step 3
   
   - |C| that the tag is still available for further tagging as long as untagged objects are within your selection [:ref:`AnnotateM007`,  :ref:`AnnotateM008`]

#. Mouse over the annotation name (right-hand pane)

   - Selecting a SINGLE annotated object

        - |C| that the owner of the annotation is indicated, who annotated etc.[:ref:`Annotate002`, :ref:`Annotate003`]

   - Selecting 2 or more objects which you annotated yourself

        - |C| that you can see the annotations [:ref:`AnnotateM003`, :ref:`AnnotateM004`]

   - Selecting 2 or more objects annotated by another user

        - |C| that the link owner is indicated in brackets [:ref:`AnnotateM005`, :ref:`AnnotateM006`]


**Section 2: Tagging**

#. Prepare (if not prepared for you already) by creating around 10 tags belonging to you as well as to other users and at least 2 Tag Sets with Tags in them. 

#. Bring up the tagging dialog by clicking on  ``+`` button or (Insight only) by selecting ``Tag`` in the right-click menu [:ref:`Annotate009`, :ref:`Annotate010`].

#. Select a tag and click add (``>``)

   - |C| that the tag is added to the ``Selected`` area.

   - |C| that when you select a Tag Set and. click add (``>``), all the tags in the Tag Set move to the ``Selected`` area.


#. (Insight only) Add/Remove All 

   - Go to the selected area. Select a tag (contained in a tag set) and click remove (<). The tag should be displayed under the tag set in the available area.

   - Click on Add All button (``>>``). |C| that only tags are added to the selected area, not any empty tag set.

   - Click into the filter box above ``Selected`` window and type - |C| that no tags are appearing in ``Available`` after this.

   - Click on remove all Button (``<<``). check that all tags are moved back.


#. Add new

   - Create a new tag (with new name). Click add. 

     - |C| that the new tag is added to the ``Selected`` area.

   - Create a new tag (with new name). Hit Enter. 

     - |C| that the tag is added to the ``Selected`` area.

   - Create a new tag whilst highlighting a Tag Set or a Tag in a Tag Set.

     - |C| that the new tag has been created as a part of this Tag Set.

   - Create a new tag, using an existing tag name, or an existing tag name and description from the ``Available`` list. 

     - |C| that a warning dialog pops up [:ref:`Annotate011`, :ref:`Annotate012`].

     - Click ``Yes``. |C| that the existing tag will be moved to the ``Selected`` window.

     - Click ``No``. |C| that no tag was added to the ``Selected`` section.

   - Try to create new tags which match the names of existing tags within Tag Sets in ``Available``. 

     - |C| that the Tag from the Tag Set was added after you clicked ``Yes`` and no Tag was added after you clicked ``No``.

   - Filter and into the new tag box enter the name of a tag no longer displayed in the "Available" List (i.e. which was filtered out, but not ``Selected``). The dialog indicating that the tag exists should pop up. Click "Yes". The tag should be added to the ``Selected`` list.

   - Create a new tag, using an existing tag name, or an existing tag name and description from the ``Selected`` list.
 
     - |C| that a warning dialog pops up [:ref:`Annotate013`, :ref:`Annotate014`] . 
     - |C| that after you confirmed the warning dialog, no new Tag was added to the ``Selected``.

#. Filtering:

   - Start typing into the filtering box above the ``Available`` window [:ref:`Annotate015`, :ref:`Annotate016`]. 

     - |C| that only tags are filtered, this means tag set values should not be taken into account. 
     - |C| that the default option is ``anywhere in tag name``, i.e. any character in the tag is used [:ref:`Annotate017`, :ref:`Annotate018`].

   - Switch to ``start of tag name``. 

     - |C| that filtering works taking in account only the start of the tag name (similar to code completion).

   - Enter some text you can find in the middle of tags e.g. ph in filtering box, with "anywhere in the tag" selected. Now switch to "start of Tag" and |C| that the list is updated.

   - |C| that in ``Filter by owner`` menu the default is ``All`` [:ref:`Annotate019`, :ref:`Annotate020`].

   - Select ``Owned by me``, the list should be updated even if there is no text in filter box.
   - Select ``Owned by others``, the list should be updated even if there is no text in filter box.
   - Write into filtering box name of existing tag. 

     - |C| that the existing tag gets selected as you write. Hit Enter and |C| that it gets added to ``Selected``.


#. Both in the ``Available`` as well as in the ``Selected`` windows hover with the mouse over the Tags.

   - |C| that tooltip shows 

     - Owner of the tag (in all cases)
     - Description (in case the Tag has a Description)
     - Tag Set (in case the Tag is in a Tag Set)

   - |C| that the tooltip is displayed in ``Selected`` window also in cases when the Tag is 

     - newly added (i.e. addition of an existing Tag)
     - newly created and added
