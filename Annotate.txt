Annotate
========



**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check the Annotate ability (creating as well as viewing) for P/D/I/Plates/Plate Acquisitions

#. Annotate different type of objects i.e. Projects/Datasets/Images/Plates/Plate Acquisitions (=Plate Run)

   - Comments (right-hand pane [:ref:`AnnotateScreen001`])

   - Rating (right-hand pane)

   - Attachments (right-hand pane)

   - Tags (both left-hand pane right-click and right hand pane possible)

#. Repeat step 1., selecting each time >3 objects for annotation at one go [:ref:`AnnotateMScreen001`].

   - |C| that each of the selected object has been annotated, and you still see the annotation when selecting them one-by-one
   - |C| that when you select the annotated objects together with non-annotated objects, the annotation is still visible in right-hand pane [:ref:`AnnotateMScreen002`]
   
   - for Tags:
     - |C| that in case there are untagged objects in your multi-selection, the tag used on the others is still available for further tagging

#. Select an annotated object

#. Go to the right-hand side and mouse over the annotation.

   - |C| that the owner of the annotation is indicated, who annotated etc.[:ref:`AnnotateScreen002`, :ref:`AnnotateScreen003`]
   - |C| that in case of multiple selections (done in step 2) [:ref:`AnnotateMScreen003`, :ref:`AnnotateMScreen004`] and in case you did not create the link yourself, the link owner is indicated in brackets [:ref:`AnnotateMScreen005`, :ref:`AnnotateMScreen006`]
