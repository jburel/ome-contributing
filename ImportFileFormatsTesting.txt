Import File Formats Testing
============================

.. |C| replace:: **Check**

**To test in**: Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check the import of various file formats and ability to report failures correctlySee the tab: Import testing set

#. Note any special cases for the file format. These will be in the Notes column in the spreadsheet - see [:download:`here <examples/ImportTestingSetTable.pdf>`], or for special cases in a README which you must read first.

#. Import the files for this format. A known good selection is located in test_images_good or a larger set in from_skyking (see details [:download:`here <examples/ImportTestingSetTable.pdf>`]) 

   - |C| Some formats have special import requirements--please check first!
   - |C| for any import failures, and take a copy of any exceptions [import failure reasons in the "failed" button window] or other failures.[:download:`002 </images/testing_scenarios/ImportFileFormatsTesting/002.png>`, :download:`003 </images/testing_scenarios/ImportFileFormatsTesting/003.png>`, :download:`004 </images/testing_scenarios/ImportFileFormatsTesting/004.png>`]
   - |C| In case import has failed, check that all files have been copied.
   - |C| each imported image visually for the following features:
   - All images have thumbnails. Note that big images may take some time to generate thumbnails following import [clock placeholder shown] [:download:`005 </images/testing_scenarios/ImportFileFormatsTesting/005.png>`]
   - All image planes are visible, and that the correct number of planes are in each dimension [check the metadata pane] [:download:`006 </images/testing_scenarios/ImportFileFormatsTesting/006.png>`] and are of the correct size.
   - All ROIs [if any] are present and in the correct place.[:download:`007 </images/testing_scenarios/ImportFileFormatsTesting/007.png>`]
