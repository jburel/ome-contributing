**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to make sure rendering is smooth and changes are applied consistently to all visualisations of the images and all the options of rendering are functional

#. Copy settings from image [right-click on the thumbnail in central pane].[:ref:`RenderScreen001`] (Insight only)

#. Select a collection of images and paste settings.[:ref:`RenderScreen002`] (Insight only)

   - |C| that that the thumbnails in the main pane are updated.

#. Reset default settings.[:ref:`RenderScreen003`] (Web - in Full Viewer only, for one image)

   - |C| that thumbnails main viewer are updated

#. Set min/max settings. (Insight only)

   - |C| that thumbnails main viewer are updated
