Render
=======



**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to make sure rendering is smooth and changes are applied consistently to all visualisations of the images and all the options of rendering are functional

#. Copy settings from an image [right-click].[:ref:`Render001`] (both Insight and Web)

   - In Web: the right-click menu comes up only when selecting in the left-hand pane tree, not in central pane.
   - In Insight: both left-hand pane tree and central pane have the appropriate right-click menu.

#. Select a collection of images and paste the settings.[:ref:`Render002`] (both Insight and Web)

   - |C| that the thumbnails in the central pane are updated.

#. Reset default settings.[:ref:`Render003`] (Web - in Full Viewer only, for one image)

   - |C| that thumbnails in the central pane are updated.

#. Set min/max settings. (Insight only)

   - |C| that thumbnails in the central pane are updated.

#. Set owner's settings. (Insight only)

   - |C| that thumbnails in the central pane are updated [:ref:`Render004`].

#. If applicable:

   - Open an image belonging to another user.
   - Modify the settings in the "Preview" pane on the right [:ref:`Render005`] or use the icon on the top left in the Full Viewer window. Save your own setting using the "Apply" icon (Preview in Insight - NOT for Big images) Save icon (icon in Viewer - Insight) or Save button (Web) [:ref:`Render007`].
   - |C| that thumbnails in the central pane are updated.

#. Make sure you have images in "Orphaned Images" folder (get them via CLI import or do Cut command or do Move command)

#. Repeat steps 1. - 6. working on orphaned images. 

#. Repeat the steps 1. - 6. with Big Images (Find suitable images here [:download:`TestingSet </downloads/ImportTestingSetTable.pdf>`] or here [:download:`TestingTemplate </downloads/ImportTestingTemplate.pdf>`])
