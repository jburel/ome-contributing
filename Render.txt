Render
=======



**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to make sure rendering is smooth and changes are applied consistently to all visualisations of the images and all the options of rendering are functional

#. Copy settings from an image (right-click). (both Insight and Web)

   - In Web: the right-click menu comes up only when selecting in the left-hand pane tree, not in central pane [:ref:`RenderWeb003`].
   - In Insight: both left-hand pane tree and central pane have the appropriate right-click menu [:ref:`Render001`].






#. Select a collection of images and paste the settings.[:ref:`Render002`] (both Insight and Web)

   - |C| that the thumbnails in the central pane are updated.

#. Select a plate and paste the settings

   - |C| that the images in the wells update

#. (Web only) Copy settings in Preview pane (right-hand side) [:ref:`RenderWeb004`] ) and paste them 

   - in Full Viewer of another image 
   - in tree, using right-click menu [:ref:`RenderWeb003`].
   - in Preview pane of another image
   - do all 3 Paste actions also on Plate (in tree) and on single Wells in Plate (Full Viewer & Preview)
   - |C| that the Rendering settings were updated after Paste in all cases



#. (Web only) Copy settings in Full Viewer [:ref:`RenderWeb002`] ) and paste them 

   - in Full Viewer of another image 
   - in tree, using right-click menu [:ref:`RenderWeb003`].
   - in Preview pane of another image
   - do all 3 Paste actions also on Plate (in tree) and on single Wells in Plate (Full Viewer & Preview)
   - |C| that the Rendering settings were updated after Paste in all cases



#. (Insight only) Paste settings when Full viewer open

   - make sure you have 2 identical images next to each other (you can quickly import the ``test_images_good/dv/CFPNEAT01_R3D.dv`` image 2x)
   - let us call the images ``image-1`` and ``image-2``
   - open ``image-1`` in full viewer, switch off a channel and Save (icon in the top row in Full Viewer )
   - do not close the Full Viewer of ``image-1``
   - in the Data Manager (= the main pane of OMERO.insight) select the thumb of ``image-2`` and copy the rendering settings
   - select the thumb of ``image-1`` and paste the rendering settings
   - |C| that both the thumb as well as the Full Viewer of ``image-1`` have the new settings now
   - close the Full Viewer of ``image-1``
   - |C| that no ``Save`` dialog is displayed
   - re-open the ``image-1`` in Full Viewer
   - select the thumb of ``image-1`` and paste the rendering settings
   - in Full Viewer, switch off a channel again and DO NOT save
   - close Full Viewer of ``image-1``
   - |C| that the ``Save`` dialog appears
   - select ``Yes`` to save the new rendering settings
   - |C| that the thumb of ``image-1`` has updated
   - re-open ``image-1``
   - |C| that the rendering settings are as saved last time and the Full Viewer and thumb correspond

#. Reset default settings.[:ref:`Render003`] (Web - in Full Viewer only, for one image)

   - |C| that thumbnails in the central pane are updated.

#. Set min/max settings. (Insight only)

   - |C| that thumbnails in the central pane are updated.

#. Set owner's settings [:ref:`Render004`, :ref:`RenderWeb005`]. (Insight AND Web)

   - |C| that thumbnails in the central pane are updated.

 
#. Other user's data - :

   - Open an image belonging to another user.
   - Modify the settings in the "Preview" pane on the right [:ref:`Render005`] or use the icon on the top left in the Full Viewer window (Insight). In Web, click ``Edit`` in Full Viewer to modify settings. Save your own setting using the "Apply" icon (Preview in Insight - NOT for Big images) or Save icon (icon in Viewer - Insight) or Save button (Web)[:ref:`Render007`].
   - |C| that thumbnails in the central pane are updated.
   - (Insight only) use ``Apply to all`` button
   - |C| that all thumbnails in a Dataset or all wells in a Plate Run are updated

#. Make sure you have images in "Orphaned Images" folder (get them via CLI import or do Cut command)

#. Repeat steps 1. - 6. working on orphaned images. 

#. Repeat the steps 1. - 6. with Big Images (Find suitable images here [:download:`TestingSet </downloads/ImportTestingSetTable.pdf>`] or here [:download:`TestingTemplate </downloads/ImportTestingTemplate.pdf>`])

#. Other user's data ``Owner's settings``:

   - Import at least 2 multi-t and multi-z images as a user (e.g. user-4) in Read-Only group
   - Go to the imported images and modify the Rendering settings in such a way that you can recognize these settings easily later.
   - Log out and Log in as an Owner of Read-Only group (e.g. user-3) 
   - View the images you just imported as another user (e.g. user-3 viewing user-4's images)

     - |C| that, still as a default you can see the Rendering settings you just saved as the owner of the image (for example user-4), both in Insight and in Web.
     - |C| that in Insight, when you change Rendering settings and click ``Apply`` in Preview pane, your own settings appear in the list under ``Saved by``.
     - Change Rendering settings in Insight and click ``Apply to All`` in Preview pane, followed by clicking ``Reset`` in Preview pane and again ``Apply to All`` 
       
       - |C| that the thumbnail, the image in Preview and the image in 
         the Full Viewer still match. 

#. Repeat the step 14, this time in Read-Annotate and Read-Write groups (note that you do not have to be Owner in these groups to save your own settings on other's images). 

#. Import images as a user (e.g. user-4) in Read-Only group and modify Rendering settings in easily recognizable manner. Log out, Log in to Web as an Administrator (e.g. user-6), which is NOT an Owner of Read-Only group and view the images you just imported. 

     - |C| that you can see the Rendering settings you just saved as the owner of the image as a default
     - |C| that when you can change the settings (still in Web) and Save the new settings, the thumbnail, the Preview and the Full Viewer match and they have the newly created and saved settings. 
     - Click ``Reset`` in Web and go to Insight, logging in as the owner of the image - |C| that you have your settings (under ``Preview > Saved by``) as well as the Admins settings (= the Rendering settings of the image owner have not been deleted or overwritten by the actions of the Admin in Web, see example in [:ref:`Render008`]).
     - (Insight only) |C| that under ``Preview > Saved by`` the settings of the owner are hightlighted blue.
