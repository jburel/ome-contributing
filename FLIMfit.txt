**To test in**: Insight

Purpose of the test is to check the functionality of the standalone FLIMfit application and the communication with OMERO.insight.

FLIMfit - 4.9 and later versions
================================

N.B.: This scenario is for version 4.9 onwards of FLIMfit (i.e. OMERO 5.1 onwards).

#. On a mac make sure you have the Matlab Compiler Runtime installed - check the version number necessary. The MCR will install automatically on Windows.

#. Download the latest build of FLIMfit from :jenkinsjob:`FLIMFit-latest-mac` or :jenkinsjob:`FLIMFit-latest-win`.
   Select the component matching the version of the OMERO server you want to
   test FLIMFit against.

#. Start FLIMfit by clicking onto the application. Note that the errors are being recorded in the first window which pops up after you start the application.

#. Login to the appropriate OMERO.server in the login dialog.

#. Open Insight and login to the same server as in previous point.

#. Create a new dataset named ``Single`` and import 2 files into it: ``data_repo/test_images_good/sdt/IRF_in_file/convalaria ex 740nm 2 min.sdt`` and ``data_repo/test_images_good/sdt/IRF_in_file/nanorods ex 740 nm 2 min.sdt``.

#. Still in Insight, create a new dataset named ``Multiple`` and import files ``data_repo/test_images_good/sdt/Instrument Response Function/*.sdt`` into it.

#. Still in Insight, go to the dataset ``Multiple`` you just created and attach the file ``data_repo/test_images_good/sdt/Instrument Response Function/IRF 2013-05-22-T-15-36-21.irf`` to this dataset. 

#. Still in Insight, create a new dataset named ``Plate`` and import all ome.tiff files from ``data_repo/test_images_good/ome-tiff/plate_from_Imperial`` into it.

#. Still in Insight, go to the dataset ``Plate`` you just created and attach the file ``central irf.xml`` to this dataset. 

#. Still in Insight, create a dataset ``Results``. 

#. In FLIMfit, go ``OMERO > Load FLIM Data``. Choose the ``Single`` dataset that you created in Insight and select the file ``convalaria ex 740nm 2 min.sdt``.

   - |C| that the data have been loaded as expected - you should see the preview of the integrated intensity [screenshot].
   - |C| that when you click into the integrated intensity preview, you get fluorescence decay graphs in the middle pane of FLIMfit.


#. Load the Instrument Response Function (IRF) for this data from an image file

   - Go ``OMERO > Load IRF`` and select the image ``nanorods ex 740 nm 2 min.sdt`` from the tree on the Left of the popup.
   - |C| that you can now see additionally a pulse of the IRF in the fluorescence decay graphs in the main pane [screenshot]

#. Fit a single (selected) pixel.

   - Go ``Fit Selected Decay`` (bottom-left of the application).
   - |C| that you can now see additionally a fitted decay ( dotted line) and a graph of normalised residuals [screenshot]


#. Export decay plot to OMERO server.

   - Right-click on the image in the Decay tab and “save as’.
   -  then select the ‘Results’ dataset, that was created earlier, and enter an appropriate root-name e.g. ``Dec1``.
   - |C| in OMERO.insight that an image has been imported to the ``Results`` dataset  and that it matches the display in FLIMfit.


#. Adjust the Integrated Min. parameter

   - Find the ``Integrated Min`` parameter box, enter a value (e.g. 50) and press Enter.
   - |C| that the Integrated Intensity preview gets red areas (threshold) which expand as you increase the number in the "Integrated Min" box.


#. Fit pixel-wise

   - Make sure that the ``Global Fitting`` parameter is set to Pixel-Wise.
   - Make sure that the ``Fit Contributions`` parameter is set to ``Fitted Locally``.
   - Click ``Fit Dataset`` (bottom-left of the application).
   - |C| that the "operation in progress" popup appears.   -

#. Go to Images tab in the central pane of FLIMfit.

   - In the right-hand pane, tick the Display and Merge boxes in the tau-1, IO, I and ch2 rows.
   - |C| that for each of the box ticked, an image appears in the central pane.


#. Go ``OMERO > Export Images``.
   - Select the ``Results`` dataset and check that the root file name is set (the default should be fine).
   - |C| in OMERO.insight that the  dataset now contains 3 images for each selected parameter (tau_1, IO, I, chi) e.g. tau_1, tau_1 merge and tau_1 raw.
   - |C| that you can open the images.

#. Go to Histogram tab in the central pane of FLIMfit.

   - Using ``Parameter`` pull-down bottom-left in the central pane select tau-1.
   - |C| that an image appears in the central pane.

#. Export histogram plot to OMERO server.

   - Right-click on the image in the ``Histogram`` tab and “save as’.
   -  then select the ‘Results’ dataset, that was created earlier, and enter an appropriate root-name e.g. ``Hist1``.
   - |C| in OMERO.insight that an image has been imported to the ``Results`` dataset  and that it matches the display in FLIMfit.


#. Immediately after this, fit pixel-wise again, choosing ``2`` in the ``No. Exp`` menu.

   - |C| that the application finishes the fit without crashing.

#. In OMERO.insight delete all images in the ``Results`` dataset.


#. Load the data (multiple FOVs)

   - Go ``OMERO > Load FLIM Data From a Dataset``. Select the ``Multiple`` dataset you have created in Insight.
   - If on a 5.x.x server then type ``#2`` (or other characters which you can find in the filenames in case ``#2`` is not a part of a filename you work with) into ‘Filter by name’ window & click deselect. This will load only the data from block 1 (or other subset of data according to your selection filter).
   - In the popup check the required files are ticked then click ``Load Selected``.
   - In the popup select channel 0.
   - |C| that the data have been loaded as expected - you should see the preview of the integrated intensity [screenshot] and the list of uploaded files in the top-left corner of the application [screenshot].
