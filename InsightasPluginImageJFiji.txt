Insight as Plugin ImageJ/Fiji
==============================



**To test in**: ImageJ, Fiji

**Purpose of the test** is to check that the OMERO insight works as plugin for ImageJ/ImageJ2/Fiji and the loci_tools.jar missing is not causing a crash.

**Test on Linux as well as Windows (XP and Win7 if possible)**

#. Download the ``OMERO.insight-ij*`` build and unzip it [or copy it into] in imageJ/plugins folder [:ref:`InsightIJI001`]

**ImageJ**

#. Do not add ``loci_tools.jar`` to the ImageJ/plugins folder. If it is there, remove it.

#. Start imageJ and go ``Plugins`` > ``OMERO`` > ``Connect to OMERO``

   - |C| that a popup appears indicating that ``loci_tools.jar`` is missing.[:ref:`InsightIJI002`]

#. Click on the hyperlink in the popup. Download ``loci_tools.jar``.

   - |C| that the ``loci_tools.jar`` version (==the Bio-formats version) you are downloading matches the version of the ``OMERO.insight-ij*`` plugin (for example OMERO 4 ``loci_tools.jar`` with OMERO ``OMERO.insight-ij*`` plugin). **Note** that when testing OMERO 4, the link in the popup will point to a wrong place - you might need to download the corresponding ``loci_tools.jar`` from OMERO 4 Bio-formats download page.

#. Quit ImageJ. Copy ``loci_tools.jar`` into ``Plugins`` folder of ImageJ.

#. Restart ImageJ, and go ``Plugins`` > ``OMERO`` > ``Connect to OMERO``

   - |C| that Insight splashscreen is displayed.

#. Log in.

#. Go to the left-hand pane and select an image or import one if no images available.

#. Double-click on the image and then click ``OK`` in the ``Bio-formats Import Options`` window.

   - |C| that the image opens in imageJ.

#. Go through all steps using ImageJ64 and the platform independent version of ImageJ (download from `ImageJ homepage <http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html>`_).

**Fiji**

#. Start Fiji

#. Go ``Help`` > ``Update Fiji`` -> the update process will start.

#. When update is finished, press ``Manage Update Sites`` button.

   - if testing OMERO 4: select Bio-formats 4
   - if testing OMERO 5: select Bio-formats 5
   - make sure you have selected just either OMERO 4 or OMERO 5, never select both

#. OMERO 4 -> OMERO 5 switch workflow

   - a list of jars to update will be displayed in the Fiji updater window after you ticked Bio-formats 4 box and closed the ``Manage Update Sites`` window. 
   - click ``Apply changes``
   - Quit Fiji
   - Add the ``OMERO.insight-ij*`` plugin to the ``Plugins`` folder of Fiji
   - Start Fiji

#. Go ``Plugins`` > ``OMERO`` > ``Connect to OMERO``

   - |C| that Insight splashscreen is displayed.

#. Log in.

#. Go to the left-hand pane and select an image or import one if no images available.


#. Double-click on the image and then click ``OK`` in the ``Bio-formats Import Options`` window.

   - |C| that the image opens in Fiji.

**Note** that you might experience problems with the Fiji Updater when trying to go from OMERO 5 -> OMERO 4 in Bio-formats version. In that case, you might download a new Fiji from the website (this will be OMERO 4 by default).
