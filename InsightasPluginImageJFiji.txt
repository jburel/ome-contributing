Insight as Plugin ImageJ/Fiji
==============================



**To test in**: ImageJ, Fiji

**Purpose of the test** is to check that the OMERO insight works as plugin for ImageJ/Fiji and the ``bioformats_package.jar`` or ``loci_tools.jar`` missing is not causing a crash.

**Test on Linux as well as Windows (XP and Win7 if possible)**

#. Download the ``OMERO.insight-ij*`` build and unzip it [or copy it into] in ImageJ/plugins folder [:ref:`InsightIJI001`]

**ImageJ and ImageJ2**

Note: You can download ImageJ2 from http://developer.imagej.net/downloads.

#. Add neither ``bioformats_package.jar`` nor ``loci_tools.jar`` to the Plugins folder of ImageJ (or ImageJ2). If it is there, remove it.


#. Start ImageJ (or ImageJ2) and go ``Plugins`` > ``OMERO`` > ``Connect to OMERO``

   - |C| that a popup appears indicating that ``bioformats_package.jar`` or ``loci_tools.jar`` is missing.[:ref:`InsightIJI002`]

#. (For the release-day testing only.) Click on the hyperlink in the popup and check it brings you to a sensible place, but do not download it. 

#. (For the release-day testing only.) Download ``bioformats_package.jar`` [:ref:`InsightIJI005`] from the RC Download page which is being prepared for the release, e.g. ``https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/<version>`` (find link in the Standup Notes). 

   - |C| that the ``bioformats_package.jar`` version (i.e. the Bio-Formats version) you are downloading matches the version of the ``OMERO.insight-ij*`` plugin (for example OMERO 5 ``bioformats_package.jar`` with OMERO 5 ``OMERO.insight-ij*`` plugin). To check the ``bioformats_package.jar`` version, open ImageJ (or ImageJ2), go ``Help > About Plugins > Bio-Formats Plugins`` or ``Help > About Plugins > LOCI Plugins``  [:ref:`InsightIJI004`].

#. (For non-release-day testing only.) Download both ``bioformats_package.jar`` and ``loci_tools.jar`` that are mentioned in the popup.

   - |C| that the ``bioformats_package.jar`` version (i.e. the Bio-Formats version) you are downloading matches the version of the ``OMERO.insight-ij*`` plugin (for example OMERO 5 ``bioformats_package.jar`` with OMERO 5 ``OMERO.insight-ij*`` plugin). To check the ``bioformats_package.jar`` version, open ImageJ, go ``Help > About Plugins > Bio-Formats Plugins`` or ``Help > About Plugins > LOCI Plugins`` [:ref:`InsightIJI004`]. **Note** that when testing OMERO 5, the link in the popup will point to a wrong place - you might need to download the corresponding ``bioformats_package.jar`` from OMERO 5 Bio-Formats download page (e.g. ``http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.0.0-xxx/``).

#. Quit ImageJ. Copy ``bioformats_package.jar`` into ``Plugins`` folder of ImageJ [:ref:`InsightIJI001`].

#. Restart ImageJ (or ImageJ2), and go ``Plugins`` > ``OMERO`` > ``Connect to OMERO``

   - |C| that Insight splashscreen is displayed.

#. Log in.

#. Go to the left-hand pane and select an image or import one if no images available.

#. Double-click on the image and then click ``OK`` in the ``Bio-Formats Import Options`` window [:ref:`InsightIJI006`].

   - |C| that the image opens in ImageJ [:ref:`InsightIJI007`].

#. Replace the ``bioformats_package.jar`` with ``loci_tools.jar`` and repeat the steps 4 (on release day only) or 5 (non-release day only) and 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 (on both release and non-release days). 

#. Put both ``bioformats_package.jar`` and ``loci_tools.jar`` into Plugins folder and restart ImageJ (or ImageJ2). 

   - |C| that a duplication warning appears [:ref:`InsightIJI007b`].
   - |C| that you can still connect to OMERO and open an image.

#. Go through all steps using ImageJ64 and the platform independent version of ImageJ (download from `ImageJ homepage <http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html>`_).


**ImageJ - ROI and OMERO upload**
(This section is just pre-release testing scenario (unless stated otherwise), do not do on release day, on release day go to section **Fiji**)

#. Open an image in ImageJ, draw regions using IJ toolbar and ``Analyze > Tools > ROI Manager``. Each time you draw a new region click ``Add`` in the ``ROI Manager`` (``Ctrl + t`` can be used as keyboard shortcut).

   - export the image using ``Plugins > Bio-formats > Bio-formats Exporter`` to the local drive on your machine
   - make sure the ``Export ROIs`` tickbox in the second dialog (``Bio-Formats Exporter Options``) is ticked BY DEFAULT
   - close the image
   - close the ``ROI Manager``
   - reimport the saved image using ``Plugins > Bio-formats > Bio-formats Importer``, selecting the checkboxes ``Display ROIs``, ``Display OME-XML metadata`` and ``Display Metadata`` in the ``Bio-formats importer`` options)
   - |C| that the ``ROI Manager`` dialog pops up and lists all the regions you saved previously
   - |C| that when you tick the ``Show all`` tickbox in ``ROI Manager`` you see the regions just as you saved them on the image
   - Import the image you created into OMERO (using OMERO.insight).
   - |C| that the image has regions as you have drawn them in ImageJ and the regions are correctly displayed in Insight and Web.

#. Repeat step 1., this time draw regions using IJ toolbar and ``Image > Overlay > Add selection`` or use the shortcut ``cmd B``. Note that any regions in ``ROI Manager`` will be ignored in case the image has an ``Overlay`` to it. 

#. Open an image in ImageJ, create a rectangular region, and make a crop (``Image > Crop``). 
   
   - create a region in the cropped image and go ``Plugins > OMERO > Upload and Save to OMERO``
   - |C| that the Data Manager of Insight opens followed immmediately by Importer  [:ref:`InsightIJI007c`]
   - Select in a row both the radio button options in the Importer ``Add image from current window`` and ``Add image from all image windows`` and
   - |C| that when you click ``Add to Queue`` the image(s) gets added to the right-hand pane of importer according to the option of the radio button which you selected.
   - Do not create a new project nor select an existing one, and |C| that after you imported, you have the image in Orphaned folder.
   - Now create a new Project or select an existing project and use the default ``New From Folder`` option for Dataset and 
   - |C| that after import, a new Dataset has been created under the Project you selected/created with the name identical to the folder containing the image opened in ImageJ (e.g. if you opened the image in ImageJ from ``users/your_name/localimages/`` on your machine, the name of the Dataset should be ``localimages``)


#. Testing ``Save ROIs to OMERO`` feature

   - open an image from OMERO in ImageJ and also
   - open another image, this time from your local disk (not from OMERO)
   - draw ROIs on both images, add them to Overlay and select ``Save ROIs to OMERO`` 
   - in the first dialog select ``Save image from all open windows`` option and click ``Save``
   - |C| that another dialog pops up  [:ref:`InsightIJI007e`] asking you whether you want to also upload images not yet stored in OMERO
   - select ``Yes`` and |C| that an ``Import Location...`` dialog  [:ref:`InsightIJI007f`] pops up for selection of P/D to import the image to
   - select an existing P/D or create a new P/D and click ``Add to the Queue``
   - |C| that import immediately starts. 
   - |C| that the ``Results saved`` item in Activities pops up
   - |C| that the new image(s) are imported with the associated regions to the chosen location.
   - |C| that also the other image which was already stored in OMERO has the new regions now associated to it in OMERO.
   - close all images and ROI Manager in ImageJ

#. Using ``Save ROIs to OMERO`` to upload non-saved images as well.


   - Open at least two images stored in OMERO in ImageJ using the imageJ plugin
   - draw ROIs on both images and add them to Overlay (use ``Alt + B``)
   - select ``Plugins > Save ROIs to OMERO``
   - |C| that a dialog ``Save ImageJ Results`` pops up  [:ref:`InsightIJI007d`]
   - select in a row both ``Save image from current window`` and ``Save image from all open windows`` radio button options
   - select ``Save`` in the dialog and |C| that the regions are now saved in OMERO as chosen in the dialog
   - Draw a ROI and add it to the ROI Manager in ImageJ
   - crop the image (draw a rectangle encompassing the region you have just drawn and select ``Image > Crop``)
   - select "Save ROIs to OMERO" item in ``Plugins > OMERO``
   - |C| that the image is imported as ome-tiff WITH the region you have drawn on it.
   - close all images and ROI Manager in ImageJ



#. Draw a ROI specifically on a z or t plane.

   - open a multi-z and multi-t image stored in OMERO in ImageJ using the ImageJ plugin
   - draw a ROI in ImageJ on a particular z/t plane(s) and add them to ROI Manager in ImageJ (**Note that Overlay in ImageJ does not support t information, but does support the z information.**)
   - save the ROI using ``Save ROIs to OMERO``
   - |C| that the ROI in OMERO is associated with the correct z/t plane(s)
   - in ImageJ, go to ``ROI Manager > More > Options`` and tick the ``Associate Show All...`` box
   - restart ImageJ
   - in OMERO, prepare another image with ROIs associated to different z/t planes 
   - open the image you prepared from OMERO in ImageJ using the plugin, ticking the options ``Display Metadata``, ``Display OME-XML Metadata`` and ``Display ROIs`` options in the ``Bio-formats import options`` dialog and 
   - |C| that now the ROI is associated to a particular z and t plane(s) in ImageJ and these plane(s) correspond with the plane(s) in OMERO
   - |C| the OME-XML to see if the newly added ROI's have the correct Z,C and T information.

ex:

<ROI ID="ROI:0:0" xmlns="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/ROI/2015-01">
<Union>
<Shape ID="Shape:0:0" StrokeColor="-1" Text="0611-0860" TheC="1" TheT="1" TheZ="1">
<Rectangle Height="390.0" Width="780.0" X="470.0" Y="416.0"/>
<ROI ID="ROI:1:0" xmlns="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/ROI/2015-01">
<Union>
<Shape ID="Shape:1:0" Text="1162-2035" TheC="1" TheT="1" TheZ="1">
<Rectangle Height="584.0" Width="250.0" X="1910.0" Y="870.0"/>






**Fiji**

#. Start Fiji

#. Go ``Help`` > ``Update Fiji`` -> the update process will start.

   - |C| whether the Bio-Formats version you have in your Fiji matches the version of the ``OMERO.insight-ij*`` plugin (for example Bio-Formats 5 with OMERO 5``OMERO.insight-ij*`` plugin). To check the Bio-Formats version, go ``Help > About Plugins > LOCI Plugins`` [:ref:`InsightIJI004`]. **Note** that Fiji no longer supports Bio-Formats 4 and thus the ``OMERO.insight-ij*`` must be OMERO 5 to work with Fiji.

#. Add the ``OMERO.insight-ij*`` plugin to the ``Plugins`` folder of Fiji - on Mac, use rigth-click on Fiji icon & ``Show package content`` [:ref:`InsightIJI003`] to get to ``Plugins`` 

#. Restart Fiji

#. Go ``Plugins`` > ``OMERO`` > ``Connect to OMERO``

   - |C| that Insight splashscreen is displayed.

#. Log in.

#. Go to the left-hand pane and select an image or import one if no images available.


#. Double-click on the image and then click ``OK`` in the ``Bio-Formats Import Options`` window [:ref:`InsightIJI006`].

   - |C| that the image opens in Fiji.


**Note**  that during the update, there might be a problem with the class ``org.joda.time.Instant`` which can be found here:

::

    /Applications/Fiji.app/jars/jruby.jar
    /Applications/Fiji.app/jars/loci_tools.jar
    /Applications/Fiji.app/plugins/OMERO.insight-ij-5.0.0-rc1-ice35-b10/libs/joda-time.jar


The warning looks as follows:

::

    WARNING: multiple locations found! java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.joda.time.Instant.parse(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormatter;)Lorg/joda/time/Instant;

**Solution**: Delete the ``jruby.jar``.
