===================



**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check the De-annotate (alias Unlink, alias Remove) functionality This is another functionality than Delete (which is covered by a different scenario).

#. Go to right-hand pane in Insight

#. Unlink tags

   - Unlink particular tags (left click - chose Unlink in Insight [:ref:`DeAnnotateUScreen001`][:ref:`DeAnnotateUScreen002`], click on minus in Web to Remove)
   - Unlink all tags added by you/by others (minus sign at Tags in Insight only) [:ref:`DeAnnotateUScreen003`]

#. Repeat step 2 on attachments (Web: choose minus sign to remove - not cross to delete) [:ref:`DeAnnotateUScreen004`][:ref:`DeAnnotateUScreen005`]

#. Remove image from Dataset (Web only - icon in left hand pane)

   - |C| the image appears in the orphaned images in case it is not linked to other datasets.
