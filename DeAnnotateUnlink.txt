De-Annotate/Unlink
===================



**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check the De-annotate (alias Unlink or Remove Annotations) functionality This is another functionality than Delete (which is covered by a different scenario).

#. Go to right-hand pane in Insight

#. Unlink tags

   - Unlink particular tags (left click - chose Unlink in Insight [:ref:`DeAnnotateUScreen001`][:ref:`DeAnnotateUScreen002`], click on minus in Web to Remove)
   - Unlink all tags added by you/by others (minus sign at Tags in Insight only) [:ref:`DeAnnotateUScreen003`]

#. Repeat step 2 on attachments (Web: choose minus sign to remove - not cross to delete) [:ref:`DeAnnotateUScreen004`][:ref:`DeAnnotateUScreen005`]

#. Remove image from a Dataset, Dataset from a Project, Plate from a Screen (Web only - icon in left hand pane/right-click)

   - In case of image, |C| that the image appears in the orphaned images in case it is not linked to other datasets.
   - In case of Dataset/Plate, |C| that the Dataset/Plate appears as orphaned in the tree (not within any Project/Screen)

#. Select >3 annotated objects at once and repeat the steps 1 - 4. 

#. Repeat step 5., this time select once-annotated (with one tag/file etc. attached) as well as multi-annotated (with more tags/files etc.) objects in you multi-selection. 

   - |C| that when you remove single tags/files from multi-selected images/datasets..., the remaining attachments remain intact

#. (For permissions testing only) Go through steps 1 - 6, unlinking annotations from other users'P/D/I/Screens/Plates
