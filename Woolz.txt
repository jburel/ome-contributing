Woolz format
============



**To test in**: Command line interface 

**Purpose of the test** is to check the import of Woolz images from 
command-line.


**Find suitable images here** http://www.emouseatlas.org/emap/analysis_tools_resources/software/woolz.html


.. warning::
   You need the Woolz library compiled with the Java bindings and properly 
   configured in the environment both client-side (import) and server-side.
   Because this may require additional work, it is recommended to perform this
   testing directly on the CI nodes where the Woolz libraries are built.


#. Go to Terminal. cd into the directory where your server runs. From there:

#. Make sure the Woolz library is in the dynamic library path::
  
     $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/MouseAtlas/lib

#. Untar the WoolzTestData tarball and import its content into the server::

     $ bin/omero import ~/WoolzTestData

  - |C| that the images are correctly imported (except for those not read by Bio-Formats) 

#. Open a graphical OMERO client and check the images on the server
