Woolz format
============



**To test in**: Command line interface

**Purpose of the test** is to check the import of Woolz images from
command-line.


Prerequisites
-------------

- You need sample Woolz images. Sample files are available at
  http://www.emouseatlas.org/emap/analysis_tools_resources/software/woolz.html

- The environment used for deploying the testing OMERO.server needs to include
  the Woolz dynamic library. Ideally this step should be performed by the
  Continuous Integration deployment job.

- The Woolz library needs to be compiled with the Java bindings client-side
  and enable for the client-side session. If testing locally, you may need to
  build the library and set up your environment accordingly.
  Our preferred workflow at the moment is to use one of the CI nodes where the
  Woolz library has been compiled and use the library in the Terminal window.

Woolz testing
-------------

#. Open a Terminal and log into the CI node using your LDAP credentials,
   e.g.::

	$ ssh seabass.openmicroscopy.org

#. Make sure the Woolz library is in the dynamic library path::

     $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/MouseAtlas/lib

#. Untar the WoolzTestData tarball, e.g.::

     $ tar -xvf WoolzTestData.20120224.tgz

#. Download the Bio-Formats command-line tools and extract them.

#. Run Bio-Formats information command on the Woolz images, e.g.::

     $ ./showinf -nopix ~/WoolzTestData/artic_02_06_05.wlz

   - |C| that the images are correctly read by Bio-Formats

#. Download the OMERO.server which will be used to perform the client-side
   import, e.g.::

     $ omego download server --branch OMERO-5.1-latest --labels ICE=3.5

#. cd into the server directory

#. Import its content into the server using the CLI import::

     $ bin/omero login username@hostname:port
     $ bin/omero import ~/WoolzTestData

   - |C| that the import log does not throw any error
   - |C| that the images are correctly imported (except for those not read by Bio-Formats)

#. Open a graphical OMERO client and check the images on the server
