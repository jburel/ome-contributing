Download/Export/Downgrade
##############################################




**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check the Download, Export and Downgrade features and the downloaded files - depending on whether archived image was created at import and whether this was an FS import or not.

Note: if several images have to be downloaded a zip will be created (Web and Insight) - this might take couple of seconds with no warning.



Download non-image files (both FS and non-FS)
============================================================

**To test in**: Web, Insight

    - Import an image with a companion file e.g. ``data_repo/test_images_good/dv/CFPNEAT01_R3D.dv`` (or see column "Extra information" in [:download:`here </downloads/ImportTestingSetTable.pdf>`])

    - Select the image, go to the right-hand panel, Acquisition tab, Companion files, and (Insight only) left-click on icon to the right of the filename to see a menu.

    - |C| that you can see Info [:ref:`DownloadED001`][:ref:`DownloadED002`]and View the file 

    - Download the Companion file [:ref:`DownloadED003`][:ref:`DownloadED004`] - open downloaded file in text editor,
    - |C| that the size is not zero.[:ref:`DownloadED005`]

    - Download the metadata file created by OMERO i.e. ``original_metadata.txt`` [:download:`original_metadata.txt </downloads/Export_Downgrade_original_metadata.txt>`] (Web only - Acquisition tab) [:ref:`DownloadED007`].

    - Download the original metadata file using the menu item under the icon above right-hand pane (Insight only) [:ref:`DownloadED007b`].

    - |C| the downloaded file [:download:`008 </downloads/Export_Downgrade_008.txt>`].

    - Download the companion files as well as original metadata both into your home directory as well as to your Desktop.


non-FS-Download/Export images
============================================================

**To test in**: Web, Insight

    - Import an image - tick the "Archive" option after putting it into the Queue [:ref:`DownloadED009`] (Insight only)

    - When the import is finished, select the image

    - Go to the right-hand panel General tab,

         - |C| that you see the image is shown as ``Archived`` in Insight [:ref:`DownloadED010a`].
         - in Insight, press the Saving icon [2nd from right] and choose Download.[:ref:`DownloadED010b`].
         - in Web click on the arrow in General tab [:ref:`DownloadED011`].
         - Download both into your home directory as well as to your Desktop.
         - |C| that the image has correctly been downloaded [:ref:`DownloadED012`].
         - Re-import the image: import in Insight, but check in Web as well.
         - |C| Compare the image originally imported and the re-imported image (check also the metadata) [:ref:`DownloadED013`].

    - Import an image composed of several files, e.g. `test_images_good/lei/050118.lei` - tick the "Archive" option after putting it into the Queue [:ref:`DownloadED009`] (Insight only).

         - Select the download option on the right-hand side.
         - Download the image - a zip will be created [:ref:`DownloadED013b`].
         - Download both into your home directory as well as to your Desktop.
         - |C| that the image has been downloaded correctly [:ref:`DownloadED013c`].
         - Re-import the image: import in Insight, but check in Web as well.
         - Compare the image originally imported and the re-imported image (check also the metadata).


    - Now Select an image which had the "Archive" option off at import. If not sure, re-import an image with the "Archive" option off.
         - |C| that you see the image is not shown as ``Archived`` in Insight [:ref:`DownloadED013d`].
         - |C| that the Download option is not available neither in Insight (greyed out) [:ref:`DownloadED013e`] nor Web (menu item missing) [:ref:`DownloadED013f`].


FS-Download/Export images (perform on FS server with FS-data-only database)
========================================================================================================================

**To test in**: Web, Insight

    - FS-Single image

         - Import an image
         - Select the download option on the right-hand side [:ref:`DownloadED010b`, :ref:`FSDownloadED011`]
         - Download the image both into your home directory as well as to your Desktop.
         - |C| that the image has been correctly downloaded [:ref:`DownloadED012`]
         - Re-import the image.(import in Insight, but check in Web as well)
         - Compare the image originally imported and the re-imported image (check also the metadata) [:ref:`DownloadED013`].

    - FS-multi-image - repeat the "FS-Single image" step importing a multi-image file (e.g. `test_images_good/lei/050118.lei`). 
        
         - |C| that the whole multi-image fileset (MIF) has been downloaded. See [:ref:`DownloadED013p`]. 



Mixed FS & non-FS Download/Export images (this is to be performed on FS server with a database consisting of non-FS as well as FS images)
=================================================================================================================================================

**To test in**: Web, Insight

         - Choosing images imported using non-FS and skipping importing, go through the "18.2 non-FS-Download/Export images:" step
         - Go through the "18.3 FS-Download/Export images" step



Downgrade
============================================================

**To test in**: Web, Insight

When performing the following steps, export both into your home directory as well as to your Desktop.

    - Select an image and go to the right-hand panel.
    - Export the image as JPEG (Web & Insight) [:ref:`DownloadED016`, :ref:`DownloadED017`], PNG (Insight only), TIFF (Insight only) 

         - |C| the result

    - Export the image as OME-TIFF [:ref:`DownloadED017b`, :ref:`DownloadED017c`]

         - for Web, just export and check the file - for Insight, see below
         - Export using the current schema:[:ref:`DownloadED018`] (Insight only)
         - |C| the exported file,
         - |C| Open the file
         - |C| the XML section the schema version should indicate the latest version e.g. 2012..[:ref:`DownloadED019`].-Do it from command line [tiffinfo command from libtiff library - download tiffinfo using Homebrew][:ref:`DownloadED020`]

    - Export using an older schema:(Insight only)

         - |C| the exported file
         - |C| Open the file
         - |C| the XML section, the schema version should match the selected schema.[:ref:`DownloadED021`] - Check from command line using tiffinfo
    - Re-Import the exported files
