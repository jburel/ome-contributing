Contributor License Agreement
=============================

Similarly to other projects like the `Apache Software Foundation <https://www.apache.org/licenses/contributor-agreements.html>`__
or the `Python Software Foundation <https://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/>`__, OME uses a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to accept code contributions. This is a legal document in which a contributor states that they are entitled to contribute their work to the project and are willing to have it used in distributions and derivative works. The CLA also ensures that once a contributor has provided a contribution, they cannot try to withdraw permission for its use at a later date. People and companies can therefore use that software, confident that they will not be asked to stop using pieces of the code at a later date.

To enter the agreement, please :download:`the CLA form <ome_cla.pdf>`, fill your full name, email address, the GitHub username under which you will
make your contributions, date and sign the document. Finally, send the completed form to `contributors@openmicroscopy.org`.
