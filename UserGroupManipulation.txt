========================



**To test in**: Web (Section 2), Insight (Section 1, 2)

**Purpose of the test** is to check the viewing/display of groups/users and their data

**Section 1: User Display (Insight only)**

#. Add several groups to the display. Switch between groups. [:ref:`UserGroupMScreen001`][:ref:`UserGroupMScreen002`][:ref:`UserGroupMScreen003`]

#. Add several users to the display [:ref:`UserGroupMScreen002`][:ref:`UserGroupMScreen005`].

#. Switch between users.

#. Browse the user's data - go to the tree in left-hand pane, expand projects and datasets, view images. Go to the Screens harmonica and browse screens. Your data are unmarked, the other user's data have a red flag [:ref:`UserGroupMScreen005bi`].

#. Remove/Refresh users from/on display.(Insight only) - use both menu (remove) [:ref:`UserGroupMScreen002`] and right-click (remomve & refresh) [:ref:`UserGroupMScreen004`]

#. Remove groups from display.

#. |C| that you can see the owner of the object in the right-hand pane [:ref:`UserGroupMScreen008i`][:ref:`UserGroupMScreen008w`].

#. |C| that you can see other users' data (P/D/I/S/Plate/Plate Run) in the group on display as appropriate according to your permissions.

#. |C| that you can see annotations on other users' objects (P/D/I/S/Plate/Plate Run) as appropriate [:ref:`UserGroupMScreen009w`].. 

#. (Not to do during permissions testing). Log off and log in as a new user. Bear in mind the danger of clashes with other testers when picking a new username.

   - |C| that you can browse data
