#. Make sure you have 2 users, in two different groups, e.g. user ``share-1`` and user ``share-2`` in groups ``group-1`` and ``group-2``. 

   - User ``share-1`` has images in ``group-1``. 
   - User ``share-2`` is not a member of ``group-1`` and cannot see the images of ``share-1`` in ``group-1``. 

#. Log in as ``share-1`` and in ``group-1`` select images and add to basket [:ref:`Share001`].

#. Create a share sharing your images with ``share-2``. In the central window, click on the basket icon, choose "Manage basket"[:ref:`Share002`], choose images to share and use the "Globe" icon to create a share [:ref:`Share003`]. Choose an expiry date one day after creation [:ref:`Share004`][:ref:`Share005`]
