**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check that the entities are editable smoothly and that the edited/changed texts are being respected

#. Edit project [:ref:`EditScreen001`], dataset  [:ref:`EditScreen002`], image [:ref:`EditScreen003`], screen [:ref:`EditScreen004`], plate [:ref:`EditScreen005`], plate run [:ref:`EditScreen006`].

   - Edit name (right panel, use pencil icon) [:ref:`EditScreen008`]
   - Edit description
   - |C| in Web, that the text you put in is escaped properly, this means for example enter special html signs (e.g. <>), or scripts (e.g. '<script>alert('hello')</script>'). The Web application should not interpret them but take them as entered

#. Edit channels. 
   
   - Edit channels of an Image 

      Go to a dataset with images which have different number of channels (e.g. some images in the dataset will have 3 channels, some 5 channels). Select an image)
   
      - Edit a channel [:ref:`EditScreen001N`, :ref:`EditScreen001NWeb`, :ref:`EditScreen002N`, :ref:`EditScreen002NWeb`, :ref:`EditScreen002Nb`]
      - Click Save
      - In the same image, edit channels again, this time click "Apply to All"
      - |C| that the warning message is displayed [:ref:`EditScreen003N` :ref:`EditScreen003NWeb`].
      - Click Save (or "Continue" in Insight) and |C| that the changes were made only on images with the same number of channels, but NOT on images with different number of channels (e.g. only 3 channel images channel names are changed when a 3 channel image was selected, NO changes on 5 channel images in ANY of the channels)
      - Edit channels again, click "Apply to All", then click Cancel and |C| that the original channel names are reset
      - Open an image in Full Viewer, edit channels, make changes, click Save (Full Viewer is still open) [:ref:`EditScreen004N`, :ref:`EditScreen004NWeb`] and |C| that the changes are immediately displayed also in Full Viewer [:ref:`EditScreen005N`, :ref:`EditScreen005NWeb`]

   - Edit channels of a Plate

      Choose a plate, click on a well sample, edit the channels, make changes and click "Apply to All" [:ref:`EditScreen006N`, :ref:`EditScreen006NWeb`, :ref:`EditScreen006Nb`,  :ref:`EditScreen006NbWeb`]



#. Edit share (Web only) [:ref:`EditScreen009`][:ref:`EditScreen010`],
