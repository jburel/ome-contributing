Edit
=====



**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check that the entities are editable smoothly and that the edited/changed texts are being respected

#. Edit project [:ref:`EditScreen001`], dataset  [:ref:`EditScreen002`], image [:ref:`EditScreen003`], screen [:ref:`EditScreen004`], plate [:ref:`EditScreen005`], plate run (i.e. plate acquisition) [:ref:`EditScreen006`], field (i.e. Well sample) [:ref:`EditScreen007`]

   - Edit name (right panel, use pencil icon) [:ref:`EditScreen008`]
   - Edit description
   - |C| that the text you put; in is escaped properly, this means for example
   - Enter special htmil signs (e.g. <>), or scripts (e.g. '<script>alert('hello')</script>'). the application should not interpret them but take as entered

#. Edit share (Web only) [:ref:`EditScreen009`][:ref:`EditScreen010`], 

   - |C| that the text you put; in is escaped properly - try to enter html special signs (e.g. <>), or scripts (e.g. <script>alert('hello')</script>)
