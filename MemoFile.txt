Memo file
======================



**To test in**: Insight, Server logs

**Purpose of the test** is to check the creation of the memo file is being created and revisited when images are imported/viewed.

#. Import a file, e.g ``.nd2``

   - |C| that the import log in the managed repository and the Blitz log 
     there is a line such as ``saving memo file ...`` which appears the 
     first time the server calls the setID method

#. Try to open the file you imported in the viewer.

   - |C| that the import log in the managed repository and the Blitz log
     show ``loading memo file...`` every time you open the image.
