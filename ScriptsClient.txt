Scripts Client
===============



**To test in**: Web, Insight


**Purpose of the test** is to test the scripting functionalities, mainly checking the script launching on various targets and reporting about the script run. Further, the most popular scripts (export scripts, publishing options) are being more thoroughly tested for output formats.

#. Select a dataset

#. Open list of available scripts.[:ref:`ScriptClientScreen001`]

#. Select a script running on datasets.[:ref:`ScriptClientScreen002`][:ref:`ScriptClientScreen003`]

   - |C| that the data type is set to dataset and the id of the dataset is displayed in the id field.

   - Select other data type if applicable,

   - |C| that the id is removed.[:ref:`ScriptClientScreen002`][:ref:`ScriptClientScreen003`]

#. Select the initial data type and enter the initial id.

#. Run the script and

   - |C| that an entry is added to the activities section [:ref:`ScriptClientScreen004`][:ref:`ScriptClientScreen005`]

#. Click on the result link e.g.

   - |C| View if the script ran to completion w/o errors.[:ref:`ScriptClientScreen006`][:ref:`ScriptClientScreen007`]

   - |C| that you can view the results of the scripts

   - |C| that you can download the results of the scripts and view the downloaded


#. Repeat all steps with another type e.g. Image

#. Select >3 images and run Batch image export script [:ref:`ScriptClientScreen002`] from Export Scripts submenu
	
   - Choose other output formats than the default (=.jpeg) like .tiff, tiff-ome and .png [:ref:`ScriptClientScreenN001`]

   - Download and unzip the resulting file and

   - |C| the correct format was indeed exported by the script

#. Select an image, create a rectangular ROI and repeat point 8. running Movie ROI Figure script from the Figure Scripts submenu


#. Go to the right-hand pane in Insight, General tab and run the following publishing options scripts [:ref:`ScriptClientScreenN002`]

   - Split View Figure

   - ROI Split Figure (create a rectangular ROI first, then run the script)

   - Thumbnail Figure

   - Movie Figure

   - Choose other output formats than the default (=.jpeg) like .tiff, ome-tiff and .png [:ref:`ScriptClientScreenN001`]

   - |C| the correct format was indeed exported by the script

#. |C| the consistency of script submenus, namely that scripts from the the right-hand pane icon ("publishing options" [:ref:`ScriptClientScreenN002`]) are not duplicated in the left-hand panel icon in Insight (the main Scripts menu [:ref:`ScriptClientScreenN003`])

#. |C| the consistency between Insight and Web - are the scripts displayed logically in the corresponding submenus in both clients ?
