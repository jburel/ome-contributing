=======



**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check the Delete function on all entities (except ROI)

If you test work on other's data (permissions) go first to :ref:`Work on others data <label-name>`

.. _delete-work-own:

#. In the DataManager:

   - Delete Ratings (Insight only), Delete Comments (right-hand pane)
   - Delete attachments [:ref:`DeleteScreen001`][:ref:`DeleteScreen002`] (left-hand pane in Insight, right hand pane in Web)
   - Delete tags [:ref:`DeleteScreen003`][:ref:`DeleteScreen004`] (left-hand pane)

#. Delete P/D/I/Screen/Plate. [:ref:`DeleteScreen005`][:ref:`DeleteScreen006`][:ref:`DeleteScreen007`][:ref:`DeleteScreen008`]

#. Import an image rich in metadata and delete it.

**End of scenario working on own data**
