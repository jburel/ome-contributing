Delete
=======



**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check the Delete function on all entities (except ROI)

If you test work on other's data (permissions) go first to :ref:`Work on others data <label-name>`

.. _delete-work-own:

#. In the DataManager:

   - Delete Ratings (Insight only), Delete Comments (right-hand pane)
   - Delete attachments [:ref:`DeleteScreen001`][:ref:`DeleteScreen002`] (left-hand pane in Insight, right hand pane in Web)
   - Delete tags [:ref:`DeleteScreen003`][:ref:`DeleteScreen004`] (left-hand pane)

#. Delete P/D/I/Screen/Plate. [:ref:`DeleteScreen005`][:ref:`DeleteScreen006`][:ref:`DeleteScreen007`][:ref:`DeleteScreen008`]

#. Import an image rich in metadata and delete it.

**End of scenario working on own data**



.. _label-name:

**Work on other user's data**

#. 

   - |C| the permissions of the user you have been assigned to use here: :ref:`Table of permissions <Table-of-permissions>`
   - |C| whether you CAN (=Y) or CANNOT (=N) delete other's data in the table below:



.. tabularcolumns:: |l|c|c|c|

=================== ======= ========= =============
Group Administrator Private Read-only Read-annotate
------------------- ------- --------- -------------
    Delete             Y        Y          Y
=================== ======= ========= =============

|

.. tabularcolumns:: |l|c|c|c|

================ ======= ========= =============
Group Ownder of  Private Read-only Read-annotate
---------------- ------- --------- -------------
    Delete          Y        Y           Y
================ ======= ========= =============

.. tabularcolumns:: |c|c|c|c|

================ ======= ========= =============
Group Member of  Private Read-only Read-annotate
---------------- ------- --------- -------------
     Delete         N        N           N
================ ======= ========= =============

#. Go through the steps 1.- 3. :ref:`above <delete-work-own>` and
   
   - |C| that you CAN/CANNOT (as appropriate) delete (but DO NOT DELETE them!) other's data named in this scenario (images..., ratings, attachments, tags)

   - |C| you see this - `link to the table with screenshots about permissions - visibility of objects - does not exist yet`
  
#. Go through the steps 1.- 3. :ref:`above <delete-work-own>` and

   - |C| you can delete YOUR OWN image annotated by other users or with ROIs added by other users (this should be always possible)
