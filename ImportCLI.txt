Import CLI
===========



**To test in**: Command line interface / Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check the import of single, multiple images and multi-images file from command line


**Find suitable images here** [:download:`TestingSet </downloads/ImportTestingSetTable.pdf>`] or here [:download:`TestingTemplate </downloads/ImportTestingTemplate.pdf>`]

#. Open Insight (UI), create a Dataset, note the Dataset ID

#. Go to Terminal (command line interface, CLI). From CLI

#. Log in onto appropriate server and user. Import a single image without an accompanying file [:download:`001 </downloads/CLI_001.txt>`]

   - |C| that the file was imported using Insight UI [:ref:`ImportCLIScreen002`]

#. Import several images in one transaction (a whole folder).[:download:`003 </downloads/CLI_003.txt>`]

   - |C| that the files were imported using Insight UI [:ref:`ImportCLIScreen004`]

#. Import an image with a companion file e.g. ``data_repo/test_images_good/dv/CFPNEAT01_R3D.dv``, or see "Extra information" in [:download:`here </downloads/ImportTestingSetTable.pdf>`]

   - |C| that the file was imported and you can see the companion file.- Acquisition tab, Companion files [:ref:`ImportCLIScreen005`]
   - |C| that you can download the companion file

#. Select a folder with a multi-images file (like ``test_images_good/lei``) [:download:`007 </downloads/CLI_007.txt>`][:ref:`ImportCLIScreen006`]

   - |C| that you can see the imported images within the file

#. Try import into an existing database (use -d <databaseID>) and archive images at import (use -a) - e.g. ``import -a -d 101 ~/Desktop/dv/CFPNEAT01_R3D.dv``

   - |C| the image has been imported into the right database and archived

#. Import a nested folder containing Screen/Plate/Well files
