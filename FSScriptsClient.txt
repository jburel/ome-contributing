FS Scripts Client
==================



**To test in**: Web, Insight


**Purpose of the test** is to test the scripting functionalities. For FS demo, check mainly the scripts which have Projections as a part of their performance and check that the scripts do produce Info and Errors files.

**Download both Gretzky and Howe builds and compare the speed of the workflow on the same images on Gretzky vs Howe. Test ALL images pre-loaded on Gretzky and Howe, see:**
`FS testing table <http://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoKiTAl8UOxndER5UF9mczRNNklxbWFfakN4clhDaXc#gid=0>`_ 

#. Run the following scripts which have projections as a part of their run

   - Batch image export

   - Movie ROI Figure (create a rectangular ROI first, then run the script)

   - Movie Figure (select the option "Z-projection")

   - |C| that the output (attachment) is present




#. Click on the result link and


   - |C| that the Info (and Error if applicable) files are present - it should be present even if no output was produced

   - |C| that script ran to completion w/o errors.[:ref:`ScriptClientScreen006`][:ref:`ScriptClientScreen007`]

   - |C| that you can view the results of the scripts

   - |C| that you can download the results of the scripts and view the downloaded results
