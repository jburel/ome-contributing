FS Scripts Client
==================



**To test in**: Web, Insight


**Purpose of the test** is to test the scripting functionalities. For FS demo, check mainly the scripts which have Projections as a part of their performance and check that the scripts do produce Info and Errors files.

**Download both Gretzky and Howe builds and compare the speed of the workflow on the same images on Gretzky vs Howe. Test ALL images pre-loaded on Gretzky and Howe, see:**
`FS testing table <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoMHD4RIe-94dHJabm9UWVo0VzRqVnhBalk1eEJKZlE#gid=4>`_ 

#. Run the following scripts which have projections as a part of their run

   - Batch image export (in "Choose z-section" select Projection)

   - Movie ROI Figure (create a rectangular ROI first, then run the script)

   - ROI Spli Figure (create a rectangular ROI first, then run the script)

   - Movie Figure (tick the box "Z Pprojection")

   - Split View Figure

   - |C| that the results link is present [:ref:`FSScriptsClientScreen006`]


#. Click on the result link and


   - |C| that the Info (and Error if applicable) files are present - Info should be ALWAYS present [:ref:`FSScriptsClientScreen006`]

   - |C| that script ran to completion w/o errors.[:ref:`FSScriptsClientScreen006`][:ref:`FSScriptsClientScreen007`]

   - |C| that you can view the results of the scripts

   - |C| that you can download the results of the scripts and view the downloaded results
