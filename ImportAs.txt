Import As
===============



**To test in**: Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check importing for other users.


NB: Only Administrators can import data for other users. 
NB: When importing the data for another user, the permissions to link these data to a third party P/D/S is dependent on the permission levels of the user for whom the data is being imported ( = the owner of the data).

#. Check the permission levels for linking the data to other users' P/D/S (= Link/Unlink).

#. Read the :ref:`Table of permissions-users <Table-of-permissions-users>`. You will pick or you have been assigned to 3 users from the same group:
 
   - an administrator
   - a user which can Link
   - a user which cannot Link

#. Make sure you have images ready on your local hierarchy. Use small images which can be found here. You will need to have images without folders as well as whole folders with images ready for the import.

   - prepare folders with images for the user which can Link
   - prepare folders with images for the user which cannot Link

#. In Insight UI, prepare Projects and Datasets for the users for which you will import later

   - Login as the user which cannot Link.
   - Create a project for the data for the user which cannot Link (e.g. "user-3 for user-3's data")
   - Create a project for the data of the user which can Link (e.g. "user-3 for user-11's data")
   - Login as the user which can Link.
   - Create a project for the data of the user which can Link (e.g. "user-11 for user-11's data")
   - Create a project for the data of the user which cannot Link (e.g. "user-11 for user-3's data")
   - Login as administrator
   - Create a project for the data of the user which cannot Link (e.g. "user-6 for user-3's data") 
   - Create a project for the data of the user which can Link (e.g. "user-6 for user-11's data")

#. Log in as administrator.

#. Switch to Group Display. 

#. Import for the user which can Link. 

   - Open Importer, choose data, click ``>``.
   - In the Import Location window, select ``Import For`` the user which can Link [:ref:`ImportAsScreen001`]
   - Import the images with no folder - do not create new project or dataset at import
   -             	

-  - |C| that new Dataset was created and the images were imported as appropriate [:ref:`ImportAsScreen002`]
   - |C| that the owner of the dataset and of the imported images is indicated as intended at import [:ref:`ImportAsScreen002`] 


#. Log in as a group member (e.g. .....)

#. Create a new Project at import stage...

#. Repeat the same with plates. Use BD pathway plate to import.

#. Repeat the same being in User View.
