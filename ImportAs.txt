Import As
===============



**To test in**: Insight and Web (Web - viewing the imported plates/images 
only)

**Purpose of the test** is to check importing for other users.


NB: Only Administrators can import data for other users (**NO Import As** is 
permitted in **private** group though). When importing the data for another 
user, permission to put these data into a **third party** P/D/S depends on the permission levels of the user for whom the data is being 
imported ( = the owner of the data).

#. Check the permission levels for putting the data to other users' P/D/S (= 
Mix Data) :omerodoc:`here <sysadmins/server-permissions.html>`.


#. Read the :ref:`Table of permissions-users <Table-of-permissions-users>`. 
You will pick or you have been assigned to 3 users from one group.:
 
   - an administrator (e.g. user-6)
   - a user who CANNOT Mix ("No Mix" = NM) - referred to as user-NM from 
     here
   - a user who Can Mix (CM) - referred to as user-CM from here


#. Make sure you have images ready on your local hierarchy. Use small images
which you can pull
from `here <https://github.com/ome/omero-setup>`_, and some multi-well plate, 
like ``test_images_good/bd-pathway/2009-05-01_000/``. You will need to have 
well-named images and plates within well-named folders.

   - prepare folders with images for user-NM
   - prepare folders with images for user-CM
   - prepare folders with plates for user-NM
   - prepare folders with plates for user-CM

#. In Insight UI, prepare Projects and Datasets for the users for whom you 
will import later

   - Login as user-NM.
   - Create a Project and a Screen for the data for user-NM (e.g. "user-NM for 
     user-NM's data")
   - Create a Project and a Screen for the data of user-CM (e.g. "user-NM for 
     user-CM's data")
   - Login as user-CM.
   - Create a Project and a Screen for the data of user-NM (e.g. "user-CM for 
     user-NM's data")
   - Create a Project and a Screen for the data of user-CM (e.g. "user-CM for 
     user-CM's data")
   - Login as administrator
   - Create a project and a Screen for the data of user-NM (e.g. "user-6 for 
     user-NM's data") 
   - Create a project and a Screen for the data of user-CM (e.g. "user-6 for 
     user-CM's data")

#. Log in as administrator.

#. Switch to Group Display. 

#. Import for user-CM, do not create a new Project at import stage. 

   - Open Importer, select the folder you prepared in step 3 for user-CM, 
     click ``>``.
   - In the Import Location window, select ``Import For`` user-CM 
     [:ref:`ImportAs001`]
   - Open the Projects menu, you should be able to select the Projects of the 
     user-CM and other users' Projects [:ref:`ImportAs002`]. 
   - Select the Project owned by the user-NM (e.g. "user-NM for user-CM's 
     data") [:ref:`ImportAs003`] and import.
   - Select the Project owned by the user-CM (e.g. "user-CM for user-CM's 
     data") and import.
   - Select the Project owned by the admin (e.g. "user-6 for user-CM's data") 
     and import

#. Import for user-NM, do not create a new Project at import stage

   - Select ``Import For`` user-NM
   - Open the Projects menu, you should see all projects, but not be able to 
     select any Projects except the ones owned by user-NM [:ref:`ImportAs004`]
   - Select the Project owned by the user-NM (e.g. "user-NM for user-NM's 
     data") and import.


#. Repeat steps 7, 8 importing single images (not a whole folder).

#. Repeat steps 7, 8 importing plates (small multi-well e.g. 
``test_images_good/bd-pathway/2009-05-01_000/``).

#. Repeat steps 7, 8 creating a new 

   - Project at import stage and importing to it
   - Dataset at import stage and importing to it
   - Screen at import stage and importing a plate to it.

#. Check the imported objects.

   - Start checking in Web first, then in Insight. View the data logged in as 
     the user who did not import them and does not own them.
   - |C| that new P/D/S were created and the images and plates were imported 
     as appropriate [:ref:`ImportAs005`]
   - |C| that the ownership of the P/D/S and of the imported images and plates 
     is as expected [:ref:`ImportAs006`] 




#. Switch to User Display. Note that now you cannot see other users' Projects 
in the Import Location window. The only Projects which you can see and select 
are owned by the user you are importing for [:ref:`ImportAs007`].

   - Working in User Display mode, repeat steps 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
