Web Open Astex Viewer
=======================


**To test in**: Web, (InsightUI just for import)

**Purpose of the test** is to check the Astex Viewer application in Web client

#. Choose a map from from  <http://emdatabank.org/recententries.html>

   -  Click on 'PDBe' for an entry that looks decent and is larger than 120x120x120. See 'Map Information'
   -  Click on the .map.gz (first line in Map information, next to Map:) to download it
   -  Go to Downloads and grab the map.gz, unzip and import (use Insigh UI)

#. View the image in web: you should see an option for 'Volume Viewer' in the web `General` pane for that image [:ref:`OpenAstex001`]

#. Open the Volume viewer. You might need to start a java applet in the middle of the viewer first. [:ref:`OpenAstex002`]

#. Zoom, rotate, pan.

#. |C| the following controls

   -  Wire-frame vs solid
   -  Adjust contour level. You should see "something" for all but the extreme ranges.
   -  Try loading a larger map (not scaled down). This option will not appear if the original is below 120
   -  Try loading 'raw' data (float). This option will not appear if it is not a float pixel type (most are) - for large or complex images this step may fail.
   -  Adjust the contours again to check they are working with float values.
