Import (UI)
===========



**To test in**: Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check all the features of Importer UI as started from Insight

Find suitable images here [:download:`TestingSet </downloads/ImportTestingSetTable.pdf>`] or here [:download:`TestingTemplate </downloads/ImportTestingTemplate.pdf>`]

#. Select single image files

   - Add them to the queue by pressing the ">" control.
   - Select "New From Folder" option [:ref:`ImportUI001`] when choosing where to import the images.
   - |C| that a new Dataset will be created with the name of the folder.
   - |C| that the icon of the Dataset (right-hand side of the Import window) is light blue, not plum color as for Project [:ref:`ImportUI002`]
   - Click import.
   - Go to the DataManager.
 
     - |C| that the wheel in the toolbar is spinning when import in progress [:ref:`ImportUI004b`]
     - |C| that the number next to green tick is incremented when an import is finished successfully.

   - Still in Data Manager (left-hand side), hit the refresh button
     - |C| that only one dataset is created. [:ref:`ImportUI003`]

#. Repeat (1) this time selecting a whole folder to import. [:ref:`ImportUI004`].

   - |C| that the counter in the toolbar of Data Manager (right-hand side) counts the imported files correctly [:ref:`ImportUI004b`].

   - |C| that only one dataset was created for the imported folder.
   - Import another folder and again check that just one dataset was created and no duplicate imports or re-imports of the previous folder occurred.

#. Repeat (1) this time not selecting "New From Folder" but creating a new Project and Dataset at the import stage [:ref:`ImportUI004c`, :ref:`ImportUI004d`].

#. Duplicate and Companion File: Select a dv image like ``data_repo/test_images_good/dv/CFPNEAT01_R3D.dv`` and its log file, (``data_repo/test_images_good/dv/CFPNEAT01_R3D.dv.log``).

   - add both files to the import queue
   - click import
   - |C| that you get a message indicating that the log file is a duplicate, i.e. that this file has been already imported in this transaction
   - |C| that the import of the duplicate does not proceed (in this transaction)
   - |C| that the counter in the Toolbar of the Data Manager is not counting the skipped files as ``Imported``
   - |C| the Companion File:
      
     - Go to the Data Manager, right-hand pane, Acquisition tab
     - |C| that the first harmonica tab is ``Companion file`` (NOT ``Original Metadata``)
     - Expand the ``Companion file`` harmonica tab and check the file is there

#. (FS only) Upload.

   - import several images in one transaction, making sure you have images with long ``processing`` times, for example ``data_repo/test_images_good/leica-lif/free edge 6.lif`` or other ``.lif`` files
   - |C| that the import of the files in the queue starts immediately after the upload of the previous file is finished
   - |C| that the size in the header of the importer window changes after each import

#. Cancelling: 
   
   - Cancel a single running import using the ``Cancel`` button.
   - |C| that only this particular import has been cancelled
   - Cancel all imports using the ``Cancel All`` button
   - |C| that you get a warning popup.
   - Click ``Yes`` in the popup. 
   - |C| that all the imports where the upload did not start yet are cancelled
   - |C| that after everything is imported or cancelled the spinners stop both in Importer and Data Manager.
   - Repeat step 6 when importing a whole folder (for example ``test_images_good/dv``).

#. Tag at import (for permissions testing, tag with tags belonging to other users)

   - Select at least 2 images.
   - Go to the "options" tab. The second tab when selecting the import location.[:ref:`ImportUI005`]
   - Create a new tag
   - Import the images.
   - Go to the DataManager (left-hand side). Refresh
   - |C| that the images are tagged and the tag is shown on thumbnails [:ref:`ImportUI006`][:ref:`ImportUI007`]
   - |C| and the tag is created once. [:ref:`ImportUI008`]

#. Repeat (3) and this time (for permissions testing, tag with tags belonging to other users)

   - create a new tag and add an existing tag.[:ref:`ImportUI009`]
   - Import the images
   - Go to the DataManager (left-hand side). Refresh,
   - |C| that the images are tagged and the tag is shown on thumbnails
   - |C| that the tag is created once
   - |C| that no new tag is created with the name of an existing tag.

#. In the Location dialog, press the Screen button [:ref:`ImportUI011`]

#. Import a Plate e.g. ``test_images_good/bd-pathway/2009-05-01_000/`` 

   - not creating new Screen at import stage [:ref:`ImportUI011b`]
   - creating a new Screen to import the plate to at import stage [:ref:`ImportUI011c`]



#. When the import is done, check in the Importer Window:

   - |C| that thumbnail(s) is(are) created [:ref:`ImportUI012`].
   - |C| that when you hover over thumbnail(s), a larger thumbnail view pops up [:ref:`ImportUI012b`].
   - |C| that clicking on the thumbnail(s) opens the image in Viewer. In case of a multi-image file [:ref:`ImportUI013b`], click on every thumbnail in the row.
   - |C| the ``View`` menu: [:ref:`ImportUI013c`].

     - |C| that the ``In Full Viewer`` item opens the image in viewer
     - |C| that the ``In Data Browser`` item brings you to the image in data tree in Data Manager
     - |C| that the ``View Import Log`` item shows the Log file [:ref:`ImportUI013f`]
     - Import the folder ``data_repo/test_images_broken/broken_images_scenario/`` into a non-default group (you have to switch the group actively) and after it failed, go Failed > View Import Log. |C| that the import log appears.
     - (FS only) |C| that the ``Checksum`` item opens the checksum popup [:ref:`ImportUI013d`, :ref:`ImportUI013e`] 



#. (FS only) Error reporting in all import stages.

   - Failure at scanning stage: Import ``test_images_bad/Mike.dv`` and 

     - |C| that

       - you can submit the failure. There will be no log, but you should be able to submit the files (as .zip) and exceptions.
       - you have Retry as the menu option in the ``Failure`` menu.
       - the Retry All button works.
   
   - Failure of checksums: Test on a dedicated server (e.g. a server with recompiled server code in a way which causes checksum failure).

     - |C| that

       - you can submit the failure. There will be no log, but you should be able to submit the files (as .zip) and exceptions.
       - you have Retry as the menu option in the ``Failure`` menu.
       - the Retry All button works.

   - Failure at processing stage: Import ``test_images_broken/volocity/3 Colour.acff`` and ``data_repo/test_images_broken/broken_images_scenario/``

     - |C| that

       - you can submit the .zip, consisting of the file AND log
       - you can submit the exceptions
       - you have Retry as the menu option in the ``Failure`` menu.
       - the Retry All button is greyed out.

     - Import the folder ``data_repo/test_images_broken/broken_images_scenario/`` into a non-default group (you have to switch the group actively) and after it failed, go Failed > View Import Log. 

       - |C| that the import log appears.

#. Error submission process: Import an image that will fail to import e.g. ``data_repo/test_images_bad/mike1_R3D.dv`` [:ref:`ImportUI014`]

   - |C| that you can view the error.[:ref:`ImportUI015`]
   - Submit the error to the QA system using "Submit Failures" button in the right bottom corner [:ref:`ImportUI015b`]. 
   - Enter a valid e-mail address [:ref:`ImportUI016`]
   - |C| that you received a notification e-mail.
   - |C| that your email address, error message, and file links are all included on the QA webpage.
   - Send a reply comment to the QA webpage, include your email address and a message.
