View Image
===========



**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to test the View feature on multiple z/t image and to check the z-Projection creation functionality

If you test work on other's data (permissions) go first to :ref:`Section 2: Work on others data <label-name>`

**Section 1:**

.. _view-work-own:

#. Import an image with several channels/timepoint/z-sections. [:ref:`View001`]

#. Turn on/off channels, use z-slider and t-slider and play channels movie and z/t movie.

#. Go to the split-view (=multi-channel in Web). Turn channels on/off, user z and t-sliders.

#. Toggle back between views.

#. Turn on/off color/greyscale

#. Modify the rendering settings.

#. Click on Projection tab if enabled:[:ref:`FSView002`]  - in Web, click on "Max Intensity" instead

   - Preview the projection [:ref:`FSView002`] (Insight only)
   - Change the projection range (Insight only).
   - Change the projection type (Maximum or Mean - double arrow menu next to "Intensity") [:ref:`FSView003`] (Insight only).
   - Project the image.[:ref:`FSView004`][:ref:`FSView005`] (Insight only)
   - |C| the result [:ref:`FSView006`] (Insight; Web - the result will appear in the full viewer window after click on "Max Intensity")

#. Save as (Insight only):

   - JPEG, PNG - use the icon in the projection window, see [:ref:`View007`][:ref:`View008`]
   - Save split channels.[:ref:`View008`]
   - Save with all channels turned off.
   - |C| the saved files.

**End of Section 1: working on own data**

.. _label-name:

**Section 2: Work on other users' data**

Note: Projection (step 7 in Section 1) has different permission levels than the View action. Projection has the same permissions as the "Link/Unlink" action. 

- |C| the permissions of the user you have been assigned to use here: :ref:`Table of permissions-users <Table-of-permissions-users>`
- |C| whether you CAN (=Y) or CANNOT (=N) view others' data in the table below.

#. Switch to Group Display (Insight) or put "All members" to display (Web). Go through the steps 2.- 8. :ref:`above <view-work-own>` and

   - Start viewing the data in Web first, then Insight
   - |C| that you CAN/CANNOT (as appropriate) view others' images
   - |C| that you CAN/CANNOT (as appropriate) view others' plates
   - |C| that you CAN/CANNOT (as appropriate) make Projections of others' images and that the resulting projection is in the Dataset with the projected image


#. Switch to User Display (Insight) or put a single member to display (Web). o through the steps 2.- 8. :ref:`above <view-work-own>` and

   - Start viewing the data in Web first, then Insight
   - |C| that you CAN/CANNOT (as appropriate) view others' images
