View Image
===========



**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to test the View feature on multiple z/t image and to check the z-Projection creation functionality

If you test work on other's data (permissions) go first to :ref:`Work on others data <label-name>`

.. _view-work-own:

#. Import an image with several channels/timepoint/z-sections. [:ref:`ViewScreen001`][:download:`001 </images/testing_scenarios/ViewImage/001.png>`]

#. Turn on/off channels, use z-slider and t-slider and play channels movie and z/t movie.

#. Go to the split-view (=multi-channel in Web). Turn channels on/off, user z and t-sliders.

#. Toggle back between views.

#. Turn on/off color/greyscale

#. Modify the rendering settings.

#. Projection tabs [a tab in the Full Viewer next to Image tab]:[:ref:`ViewScreen002`][:download:`002 </images/testing_scenarios/ViewImage/002.png>`] (Insight only) - in Web, click on "Max Intensity" instead

   - Preview the projection [:ref:`ViewScreen002`]
   - Change the projection range.
   - Change the projection type [Maximum or Mean - double arrow menu next to "Intensity" [:ref:`ViewScreen003`].
   - Project the image.[:ref:`ViewScreen004`][:ref:`ViewScreen005`]
   - |C| - view the result [:ref:`ViewScreen006`]

#. Save as (Insight only):

   - JPEG, PNG - use the icon in the projection window, see [:ref:`ViewScreen007`][:ref:`ViewScreen008`]
   - Save split channels.[:ref:`ViewScreen008`]
   - Save with all channels turned off.
   - |C| the saved files.

**End of scenario working on own data**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _label-name:

**Work on other user's data**


- |C| the permissions of the user you have been assigned to use here: :ref:`Table of permissions-users <Table-of-permissions-users>`
- |C| whether you CAN (=Y) or CANNOT (=N) view other's data in the table below (alternatively see all permissions `here <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/sysadmins/server-permissions.html>`_)



.. tabularcolumns:: |l|c|c|c|

==================== ======= ========== ================
CAN VIEW ?           Private Read-only  Read-annotate
==================== ======= ========== ================
Group Administrator    Y        Y           Y

   Group Owner         Y        Y           Y

==================== ======= ========== ================

#. Go through the steps 1.- 8. :ref:`above <view-work-own>` and

   - |C| that you CAN/CANNOT (as appropriate) view other's data (e.g. images, plates)



#. |C| - in case you CAN see the other's images, you should see the tags, attachments, comments of these images as well
   
#. |C| that you CAN/CANNOT (as appropriate) draw ROIs on other user's images (do not try to save the ROI - this is not covered in this scenario)

#. Go through the steps 1.- 8. :ref:`above <view-work-own>` and

   - |C| you see this - `link to the table with screenshots about permissions - visibility of objects - does not exist yet`
