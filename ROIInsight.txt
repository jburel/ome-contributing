To test in:

Insight


Purpose of the test is to check main ROI features in Insight (creation, editing, propagation, merging, result collection and export)

#. Open an image with multiple z/t planes in Full Viewer

#. Open ROI tool

   - from the icon on the top of the Full Viewer [:download:`001 </images/testing_scenarios/ROIInsight/001.png>`]
   - from the main menu Controls/Measurementâ€¦

#. Create ROIs (>3) of different types including Text [Text as one of Region types].[:download:`002 </images/testing_scenarios/ROIInsight/002.png>`]

#. Add text (=comment, description) to the shape - double-click on the shape and write. Tick and untick the "Show text" box

   - |C| Check the text (=comment...) appears and disappears.[:download:`003 </images/testing_scenarios/ROIInsight/003.png>`]

#. Select and de-select the ROIs/shapes. Check that type corresponds with Manager.

#. Move shapes and save.

#. Propagate/Merge/Split//Duplicate/Delete [Propagate first [:download:`005 </images/testing_scenarios/ROIInsight/005.png>`, :download:`006 </images/testing_scenarios/ROIInsight/006.png>`, :download:`007 </images/testing_scenarios/ROIInsight/007.png>`]. Merge only shapes from different z/t-planes, Split the Merged. [:download:`008 </images/testing_scenarios/ROIInsight/008.png>`]

   - using right-click on the image
   - using right-click on the ROI in the list in Measurement Tools window

#. Edit: change Fill and Line color [:download:`009 </images/testing_scenarios/ROIInsight/009.png>`]/ show-hide text/change width and height (Inspector tab)

   - |C| Check the changes of the region display.

#. In Results tab, add new Measurements/remove Measurements using Results wizard.

   - Click on a row, check that the chosen region/plane changes in the image.
   - Export to Excel.
   - |C| Check the file was created.


**Graph, Intensity View and Intensity Results View tabs:**

#. Choose a region propagated on >3 z/t planes & scroll through the histograms

#. Choose a Line-type of region.

   - |C| Check that both Line profile and Histogram are shown.

#. Try to create new regions when on Graph pane and to propagate them

   - Using the magic wand icon
   - Using right-click on the region
   - |C| Check: message appears "ROI assistant cannot be used in graph pane or intensity view".

#. Switch channels on/off on the image/select different regions/scroll through z planes on the Graph tab

   - |C| Check that the graphs update
   - |C| Check that the planes in the stack of images updates concurrently

#. In Intensity View tab repeat steps 12 & 13. Export to Excel.
 
   - |C| Check the file.

#. Intensity Results View tab.

   - Go away from Intensity Results View tab (i.e. select Manager tab). 
   - Still NOT being on Intensity Results View tab, select one region to add (in Results/Manager tabs or in the image itself)
   - NOW Select Intensity Results View tab (the region is still selected - do not change your selection now)
   - Press Add Selected
   - |C| Check the data were added to the table [:download:`010 </images/testing_scenarios/ROIInsight/010.png>`]
   - Try to select more regions and press Add Selected
   - |C| Check the data were added to the table [:download:`010 </images/testing_scenarios/ROIInsight/010.png>`]
   - Try Remove/Remove All.
   - Add data again and Export to Excel
   - |C| Check the file. [:download:`011 </images/testing_scenarios/ROIInsight/011.png>`]
