ROI Insight
===========



**To test in**: Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check main ROI features in Insight (creation, editing, propagation, merging, result collection and export)

**Section 1: Create ROI, Manager, Inspector and Results tabs**

#. Open an image with multiple z/t planes in Full Viewer

#. Open ROI tool

   - from the icon on the top of the Full Viewer [:ref:`ROIInsight001`]
   - from the main menu go ``Controls > ROI Tool`` 

#. Create ROIs (more than 3) of different types including Text (Text is one of ROI types).[:ref:`ROIInsight002`]

#. Add comment to the shape (double-click on the shape and write). Tick and untick the ``Show comment`` box

   - |C| that the comment appears and disappears.[:ref:`ROIInsight003`]
   - |C| that when the only action after the image was open was toggling the ``Show comment`` box, no dialog asking whether you want to save pops up

#. Select and de-select the ROIs and shapes. Check that type is correct and it corresponds with the selection in Viewer.

#. Move shapes and close the full viewer. 

   - |C| that dialog asking whether you want to save pops up.

#. Propagate shapes, Merge shapes from different z or t planes, Split shapes (which you Merged previously), Duplicate and Delete shapes [:ref:`ROIInsight005`][:ref:`ROIInsight006`][:ref:`ROIInsight007`, :ref:`ROIInsight008`]. Execute these 5 commands from

   - right-click menu on the region in the image
   - right-click menu on the ROI in the list in Measurement Tools window

#. Edit: change Fill and Line color [:ref:`ROIInsight009`]. Change width and height of a shape (Inspector tab)

   - |C| the changes of the region display.

#. In Results tab, add new Measurements/remove Measurements using Results wizard.

   - Click on a row, check that the chosen region/plane changes in the image.
   - Export to Excel.
   - |C| the file was created.


**Section 2: Graph, Intensity View and Intensity Results View tabs:**

#. Choose a region propagated on more than 2 z and 2 t planes & scroll through the histograms

#. Choose a Line-type of region.

   - |C| that both Line profile and Histogram are shown.

#. Try to create new regions when on Graph pane and to propagate them

   - Using the magic wand icon
   - Using right-click on the region
   - |C|: message appears "ROI assistant cannot be used in graph pane or intensity view".

#. Switch channels on/off on the image. Select different regions. Scroll through z planes on the Graph tab

   - |C| that the graphs update
   - |C| that the planes in the stack of images updates concurrently
   - Turn channels on off. |C| that histogram updates.

#. In Intensity View tab:

   - |C| that when no region is selected, the ``Intensity Values`` button is greyed out.
   - Select a region in the image which you have saved before.
   - Click to ``Intensity Values`` button.
   - |C| that window pops up with intensity values of single pixels [:ref:`ROIInsight009b`].
   - Toggle channels on the image on/off.
   - Change the channel selection in the ``Intensity Values`` window.
   - Export to Excel. 
   - |C| the file.
   - Close the image viewer, reopen it and open the ROI tool again.

#. Intensity Results View tab.

   - Go away from Intensity Results View tab (i.e. select Manager tab). 
   - Still NOT being on Intensity Results View tab, select one region to add (in Results/Manager tabs or in the image itself)
   - NOW Select Intensity Results View tab (the region is still selected - do not change your selection now)
   - Press Add Selected
   - |C| the data were added to the table [:ref:`ROIInsight010`]
   - Try to select more regions and press Add Selected
   - |C| the data were added to the table [:ref:`ROIInsight010`]
   - Try ``Remove`` and ``Remove All`` buttons.
   - Add data again and Export to Excel
   - |C| the file. [:ref:`ROIInsight011`]
