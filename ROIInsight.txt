ROI Insight
===========



**To test in**: Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check main ROI features in Insight (creation, editing, propagation, merging, result collection and export)

**Section 1: Create ROI, Manager, Inspector and Results tabs**

#. Open an image with multiple z/t planes in Full Viewer

#. Open ROI tool

   - from the icon on the top of the Full Viewer [:ref:`ROIInsight001`]
   - from the main menu Controls/Measurementâ€¦

#. Create ROIs (>3) of different types including Text [Text as one of Region types].[:ref:`ROIInsight002`]

#. Add text (=comment, description) to the shape - double-click on the shape and write. Tick and untick the "Show text" box

   - |C| the text (=comment...) appears and disappears.[:ref:`ROIInsight003`]

#. Select and de-select the ROIs/shapes. Check that type corresponds with Manager.

#. Move shapes and save.

#. Propagate/Merge/Split//Duplicate/Delete [Propagate first [:ref:`ROIInsight005`][:ref:`ROIInsight006`][:ref:`ROIInsight007`]. Merge only shapes from different z/t-planes, Split the Merged. [:ref:`ROIInsight008`]

   - using right-click on the image
   - using right-click on the ROI in the list in Measurement Tools window

#. Edit: change Fill and Line color [:ref:`ROIInsight009`]/ show-hide text/change width and height (Inspector tab)

   - |C| the changes of the region display.

#. In Results tab, add new Measurements/remove Measurements using Results wizard.

   - Click on a row, check that the chosen region/plane changes in the image.
   - Export to Excel.
   - |C| the file was created.


**Section 2: Graph, Intensity View and Intensity Results View tabs:**

#. Choose a region propagated on >3 z/t planes & scroll through the histograms

#. Choose a Line-type of region.

   - |C| that both Line profile and Histogram are shown.

#. Try to create new regions when on Graph pane and to propagate them

   - Using the magic wand icon
   - Using right-click on the region
   - |C|: message appears "ROI assistant cannot be used in graph pane or intensity view".

#. Switch channels on/off on the image/select different regions/scroll through z planes on the Graph tab

   - |C| that the graphs update
   - |C| that the planes in the stack of images updates concurrently
   - Turn channels on off. |C| that histogram updates.

#. In Intensity View tab repeat steps 12 & 13. Export to Excel.
 
   - |C| the file.

#. Intensity Results View tab.

   - Go away from Intensity Results View tab (i.e. select Manager tab). 
   - Still NOT being on Intensity Results View tab, select one region to add (in Results/Manager tabs or in the image itself)
   - NOW Select Intensity Results View tab (the region is still selected - do not change your selection now)
   - Press Add Selected
   - |C| the data were added to the table [:ref:`ROIInsight010`]
   - Try to select more regions and press Add Selected
   - |C| the data were added to the table [:ref:`ROIInsight010`]
   - Try Remove/Remove All.
   - Add data again and Export to Excel
   - |C| the file. [:ref:`ROIInsight011`]
