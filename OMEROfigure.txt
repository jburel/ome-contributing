OMERO.figure
##############################################




**To test in**: Web

**Purpose of the test** is to check that the OMERO.figure as an OMERO.web application is functioning correctly.

#. The redeployment of the daily CI servers currently causes the external
   scripts to be lost. If you need to test the export script, you can reupload
   it as follows where `servername` and `JOB_NAME` need to be replaced::

      $ ssh <servername>
      $ cd /home/hudson/OMERO.webapps/figure/scripts
      $ eval $(bash /home/hudson/ice/ice-multi-config.sh ice35)
      $ /home/hudson/<jobname>/bin/omero login root@<servername> -w omero
      $ /home/hudson/<jobname>/bin/omero script upload omero/figure_scripts/Figure_To_Pdf.py --official

   .. seealso::

           Table of the contributing documentation listing the servers and
           their corresponding deployment job.

#. Go to \https://<servername>.openmicroscopy.org/merge/webclient/, login to the webclient then click on Figure in top toolbar to open OMERO.figure in another tab.

#. This first series of tests checks that saved and unsaved changes are not lost inadvertantly. Creating unsaved figure can be easily done by adding a single image to a new figure (note an image ID from the webclient). If you need to make more changes, simply copy, paste and move or edit the panel.


Saving files to OMERO
============================================================

**Test that saved figures are not lost**

#. Go back to the OMERO.figure tab in your browser, answer "Create New File" in the popup and paste the URL or the ID of the image you noted in previous step into the new window which pops up. 

#. Confirm by pressing ``Add images`` button.

   - |C| that the 'Save' button becomes enabled, indicating you have an unsaved figure.

#. Save the figure (click 'Save' button or Menu: File > Save) and choose a figure name. 'Figure1'

   - |C| that the 'Save' button becomes disabled and the url updates with the figure ID. 
   - |C| that you can refresh your browser without any message popup and the figure is refreshed (not lost)

#. Copy the url, then navigate to the webclient and logout. Open new window and paste the url.

   - |C| that after login, you are redirected to the saved figure.

#. Make another change to 'Figure1' and Save. Goto File > New. Add an Image and Save 'Figure2'.

   - |C| that no popup messages asked you to save.

   - |C| that these choices work as described above.

#. Open a saved figure, then open another saved figure and make some unsaved changes.

   - Now try hitting the browser 'Back' button.
