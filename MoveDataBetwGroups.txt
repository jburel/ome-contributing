#. Move a Project with datasets and images

#. Move an Image (see here for choice of images [:download:`Images </downloads/ImportTestingSetTable.pdf>`])

   - rich in metadata

   - with an annotation
   - large image

#. Move using the right-click menu [:ref:`MoveDataScreen001`][:ref:`MoveDataScreen002`][:ref:`MoveDataScreen003`][:ref:`MoveDataScreen004`]

   - |C| that the image has been moved to "Orphaned Images" when no destination P/D was chosen in "Move to..." dialog [:ref:`MoveDataScreen002`] (Insight only)
