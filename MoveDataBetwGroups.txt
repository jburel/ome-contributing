Move Data between Groups
=========================



**To test in**: Web, Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check the feature of moving the entities between groups in all possible manners

#. Move a simple Project/Dataset/Image Screen/Plate between groups.[:ref:`MoveData001`][:ref:`MoveData002`][:ref:`MoveData003`][:ref:`MoveData004`]

   - |C| that the Project/Dataset/Image Screen/Plate is no longer in the source group and has been moved to the target group. Put group to display if necessary-Insight [:ref:`MoveData005`]

#. Move a Project with datasets and images

#. Move a Screen with Plates

   - |C| that the Plates are at the destination with all the ROIs/annotations

#. Move an Image (see here for choice of images [:download:`Images </downloads/ImportTestingSetTable.pdf>`])

   - rich in metadata 
   - with a ROI
   - with an annotation
   - large image
   - |C| that the image is at the destination with all the ROIs/annotations

#. Move using the right-click menu [:ref:`MoveData001`][:ref:`MoveData002`][:ref:`MoveData003`][:ref:`MoveData004`]

   - |C| that the image has been moved to "Orphaned Images" when no destination P/D was chosen in "Move to..." dialog [:ref:`MoveData002`] (Insight only)
 
#. Move via D&D [:ref:`MoveData006`]

   - |C| that the images are in their destinations and view them
   - |C| that the image is at the destination with all the ROIs/annotations
