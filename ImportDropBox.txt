Import DropBox
==============

.. |C| replace:: **Check**

Purpose of the test is to check the import using DropBox



1. Find the DropBox folder in your /omero folder. (i.e. ``Petr/var/omero/DropBox``)

2. Open it and create a new folder with a name matching the user ID which you are going to import images for

3. Open Terminal (command line)

4. Create a DropBox.log. Get into your home directory (i.e. petr), then into ``/Work/openmicroscopy/`` folder and then use a line like: ``tail -f dist/var/log/DropBox.log`` to create a DropBox log.

5. Drag and Drop a file (i.e. ``IAGFP-Noc01_R3D.dv``) into the DropBox subfolder you created in step 2 (i.e. ``Petr/var/omero/DropBox/petr``).

6. Observe the log info in your command line

 - |C| Check the file has been registered by DropBox [:download:`001 </images/testing_scenarios/ImportDropBox/001.txt>`] and immediatedly

7. Drag and Drop an accompanying file to the DV file you put in in step 5 (e.g. ``IAGFP-Noc01_R3D.dv.log``)

 - |C| Check the accompanying file has been registered by DropBox [:download:`001 </images/testing_scenarios/ImportDropBox/001.txt>`]
 - |C| Check that the import starts within ~60 sec (if you do not interrupt it by another file addition into DropBox) [:download:`001 </images/testing_scenarios/ImportDropBox/001.txt>`]
 - |C| Check that the files have been correctly imported (using Insight UI)
