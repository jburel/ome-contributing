Import DropBox
==============


**To test in**: Command line interface/Dropbox/Insight

**Purpose of the test** is to check the import using DropBox

#. Find the DropBox folder in your ``/omero`` folder e.g. ``Petr/var/omero/DropBox``.

#. Open it and create a new folder with a name matching the user ID which you are going to import images for

#. Open Terminal (command line)

#. Create a DropBox.log. Get into your home directory (e.g. petr), then into ``/Work/openmicroscopy/`` folder and then use a line like: ``tail -f dist/var/log/DropBox.log`` to create a DropBox log.

#. Drag and Drop a file (e.g. ``IAGFP-Noc01_R3D.dv``) into the DropBox subfolder you created in step 2 (e.g. ``Petr/var/omero/DropBox/petr``).

#. Observe the log info in your command line

   - |C| the file has been registered by DropBox [:download:`001 </downloads/DropBox_001.txt>`] and immediately

#. Drag and Drop an accompanying file to the DV file you put in in step 5 (e.g. ``IAGFP-Noc01_R3D.dv.log``)

   - |C| the accompanying file has been registered by DropBox [:download:`001 </downloads/DropBox_001.txt>`]
   - |C| that the import starts within ~60 sec (if you do not interrupt it by another file addition into DropBox) [:download:`001 </downloads/DropBox_001.txt>`]
   - |C| that the files have been correctly imported (using Insight UI)
